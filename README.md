## ⚠️ Global Declaration (Before Chaptering)

This text assumes:

- Space already exists (Book 0)
- Self-reference already exists (Book I)
- Evaluation, agency, and observers are available

This text does **NOT** assume:

- morality
- authority
- cosmic good
- free will
- external justification

**Those must be earned—or shown impossible.**

## 🧠 Key Clarification (Critical)

This book will **not** claim:

- "this explains morality"
- "this justifies ethical systems"
- "this tells you how to live"

It will claim something narrower and stronger:

> **It explains the minimal conditions under which obligation can exist at all.**

That is foundational.  
That is unsolved.  
That is orthogonal to morality.

---

## 📌 Central Thesis

> **Value is not what a system prefers.**  
> **Value is what a system cannot abandon without ceasing to be itself.**

From this:

- choice becomes meaningful,
- norms become binding,
- responsibility becomes coherent.

**No morality required.**
