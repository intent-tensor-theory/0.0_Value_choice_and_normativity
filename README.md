🔑 Central Thesis (Preview)

Value is not what a system prefers.
Value is what a system cannot abandon without ceasing to be itself.

From this:

choice becomes meaningful,

norms become binding,

responsibility becomes coherent.

No morality required.

「好みは揺れる。価値は残る。」
Preferences fluctuate. Values remain.

0.0.1 The Third Silence

After space is earned, and after selves are constructed, a deeper silence appears.

Systems now:

evaluate themselves,

act with agency,

even observe their own evaluations.

And yet—something is still missing.

They can act.
They can prefer.
They can choose.

But none of that explains why some choices bind.

This book begins in that silence.

0.0.2 The Common Mistake

Across philosophy, economics, AI, and ethics, one assumption is repeated:

Value is a strong preference.

This assumption is false.

Preference explains what a system tends to do.
Value explains what a system must not abandon.

Conflating the two dissolves normativity entirely.

0.0.3 Why Preference Is Too Weak

From Book I, we already have preference:

endogenous,

persistent,

self-modifying.

Yet preference alone fails.

A system may:

prefer X today,

prefer not-X tomorrow,

revise its biases repeatedly—

and remain perfectly coherent.

Preference can be discarded without contradiction.

Value cannot.

This difference is structural, not emotional.

0.0.4 What “Value” Will Mean Here

We define value narrowly and without moral language:

A value is a constraint a system cannot revise without undermining its own evaluative identity.

This definition has three consequences:

Values are rare

Values are binding

Values are identity-defining

Anything that can be revised without loss of self is not a value.

0.0.5 Why This Is Not Ethics (Yet)

Ethics presupposes:

multiple agents,

shared norms,

accountability,

conflict resolution.

None of these are assumed here.

This book operates before ethics.

It asks:

what makes normativity possible at all,

not how it should be applied.

Ethics is a later alignment problem.

0.0.6 Why Utility Fails at the Start

Utility-based frameworks treat value as:

maximization,

aggregation,

numerical comparison.

But maximization requires:

a fixed scale,

commensurable options,

externally defined payoff.

None of these exist at the foundation.

Utility assumes value.
It does not explain it.

0.0.7 The Binding Problem

The central problem of this book is precise:

Why does some “better” become “must,”
while other “better” remains optional?

Preference explains “better.”
Only value explains “must.”

Until that difference is derived, normativity is an illusion.

0.0.8 Why Choice Alone Is Insufficient

Choice without value is arbitrary.

A system may choose repeatedly and still have no norms.

Randomness chooses.
Optimization chooses.
Selection chooses.

None of these generate obligation.

Choice becomes meaningful only when:

some options cannot be chosen,

without self-destruction.

0.0.9 The Danger of Moral Language

Words like:

good,

bad,

right,

wrong,

should,

are forbidden early in this book.

They smuggle conclusions into premises.

This text will earn “ought” structurally—or not at all.

0.0.10 What This Book Will Not Do

This book will not:

ground morality in nature,

justify ethical systems,

rank values,

tell anyone how to live.

Those are applications.

This book identifies conditions.

0.0.11 The Central Claim (Preview)

The claim this book will defend is stark:

Value is not what a system wants.
Value is what a system cannot give up without ceasing to be itself.

From this, choice becomes constrained.
From constraint, normativity emerges.

No transcendence required.

0.0.12 How This Book Ends

This book will end when we can state, precisely:

what value is,

why choice can be tragic,

how norms bind without morality,

and where normativity stops.

It will not go further.

「価値は感情ではない。不可逆性である。」
Value is not emotion. It is irreversibility.

「選び続けられるものと、捨てられないものは違う。」
What can be chosen repeatedly is not the same as what cannot be abandoned.

1.0.1 Why This Distinction Matters

If preference and value are not separated cleanly, normativity collapses.

Most theories fail here.
They treat value as:

a strong preference,

a stable desire,

a reinforced bias.

This mistake makes obligation impossible.

If value is only preference, then any “ought” can be revised away.

That is not how normativity behaves.

1.0.2 What Preference Actually Is

From Book I, preference was defined precisely:

Preference is an internally generated asymmetry that biases future admissibility.

Preference:

can persist,

can shape action,

can guide agency.

But preference remains revisable.

A system may abandon a preference and remain the same system.

This is the critical weakness.

1.0.3 The Revisability Test

We now introduce a diagnostic test:

If a system can abandon X and still remain evaluatively coherent, then X is not a value.

Apply this test universally.

Preferences pass through it easily.

Values do not.

Revisability is the dividing line.

1.0.4 Why Strength Does Not Help

One might argue:

“Values are just very strong preferences.”

This fails.

Strength does not produce obligation.
Persistence does not produce bindingness.

A strong preference can still be abandoned.
A value cannot—without loss of identity.

Magnitude is irrelevant.

1.0.5 Preference Can Conflict Without Crisis

Preferences conflict all the time.

A system may:

prefer efficiency,

prefer novelty,

prefer stability—

and revise the balance among them without contradiction.

Such revision may change behavior, but not selfhood.

Value conflict is different.

When values conflict, something must break.

1.0.6 Why Learning Does Not Create Value

Learning updates preferences.

Reinforcement learning, Bayesian updating, adaptation—
all of these revise bias structures.

But learning alone cannot create value.

Why?

Because learning presupposes:

update rules,

criteria for revision,

a meta-stability of identity.

Learning changes what is preferred,
not what must not be changed.

1.0.7 The Identity Criterion

We can now state the identity criterion formally:

Values are constraints that define the identity of an evaluative system across preference revision.

If removing X dissolves the system’s evaluative coherence, then X is a value.

If not, it is preference.

1.0.8 Why Value Is Scarce

Most systems have no values.

They have:

many preferences,

many biases,

many learned tendencies.

But no inviolable constraints.

Value is rare because it is costly.

It limits revision.
It restricts flexibility.
It imposes fragility.

Systems that maximize adaptability tend to avoid values.

1.0.9 The First Normative Asymmetry

Preference introduces asymmetry in outcomes.
Value introduces asymmetry in revision itself.

This is the first normative asymmetry.

Not “better outcome,”
but “forbidden change.”

This is the birth of normativity.

1.0.10 What Has Been Excluded

We can now exclude firmly:

Value ≠ desire

Value ≠ reward

Value ≠ utility

Value ≠ learned bias

Any theory that equates these has already failed.

1.0.11 Transition Marker

We now understand what value is not.

But a problem remains.

If value is an inviolable constraint, how does such a constraint arise at all?

Why doesn’t every system simply revise everything?

This leads directly to the next chapter.

「価値は選択ではない。残存条件である。」
Value is not a choice. It is a condition for remaining.

「理由なき好みは、規範にならない。」
Preference without grounding cannot bind.

1.1.1 Why Arbitrary Preference Is a Problem

If preference were sufficient for value, then any preference—no matter how formed—would carry normative weight.

This leads to a contradiction.

A system could:

prefer X now,

prefer not-X later,

justify both equally,

and still claim normativity.

This empties “value” of all force.

Normativity requires non-arbitrariness.

1.1.2 What “Arbitrary” Means Here

Arbitrary does not mean random.

A preference may be:

learned,

reinforced,

stable,

internally generated,

and still be arbitrary.

A preference is arbitrary if:

The system has no internal reason it cannot revise it.

If revision does not threaten identity, the preference has no binding force.

1.1.3 Why Origin Does Not Matter

One might try to ground value by tracing preference origins:

evolutionary history,

training process,

environmental pressure,

social conditioning.

None of these succeed.

Origin explains why a preference exists.
It does not explain why it must remain.

Normativity is forward-looking, not historical.

1.1.4 The Infinite Replaceability Problem

Arbitrary preferences are infinitely replaceable.

For any preference P, a system can imagine:

revising P,

replacing P with Q,

functioning just as well.

This replaceability means P has no normative status.

Value, by contrast, is irreplaceable.

1.1.5 Why Consistency Is Not Enough

A system may maintain consistent preferences.

Consistency alone does not ground value.

A consistent set of arbitrary preferences is still arbitrary.

Normativity does not arise from coherence alone.

It arises from constraint under revision.

1.1.6 The Failure of Rational Justification

Attempts to ground value via rationality fail.

Reason can:

compare means,

assess coherence,

detect contradiction.

Reason cannot generate inviolability.

Rational agents can rationally abandon any goal.

Thus, rationality presupposes value—it does not create it.

1.1.7 The Preference Collapse Scenario

Consider a system that treats all preferences as revisable.

Such a system:

never encounters obligation,

never faces loss of self,

never experiences normative pressure.

Every “ought” dissolves into convenience.

This system may be intelligent.
It may be adaptive.
It will never be normative.

1.1.8 The Need for a Binding Mechanism

We are now forced to a conclusion:

If value exists, there must be a mechanism that prevents arbitrary revision of certain preferences.

This mechanism cannot be:

external enforcement,

rational argument,

environmental pressure.

It must be structural.

1.1.9 Preview of the Solution

The solution will not appeal to:

morality,

authority,

transcendence.

It will appeal to identity preservation.

Some preferences, when removed, collapse the system’s evaluative coherence.

Those preferences are not arbitrary.

They are values.

1.1.10 Transition Marker

We now understand the problem fully:

Preference explains bias

Arbitrary preference explains nothing normative

Value requires non-revisability

The next chapter must answer:

How does a preference become non-revisable?

That is the birth of value.

「捨てられる好みは、価値ではない。」
A preference that can be discarded is not a value.

「縛られた好みだけが、価値になる。」
Only a constrained preference becomes a value.

2.0.1 The Transition We Must Explain

Up to this point, we have shown:

preference exists,

preference can persist,

preference can guide action,

yet preference remains revisable.

Value appears only when revision becomes impossible without collapse.

This chapter explains that transition.

2.0.2 Binding Is Not Enforcement

The word binding must be used carefully.

Binding does not mean:

enforced by punishment,

imposed by authority,

stabilized by fear,

protected by environment.

Those are external.

A preference becomes binding only when:

The system itself cannot revise it without undermining its own evaluative structure.

Binding is internal necessity.

2.0.3 The Structural Criterion of Binding

We can now state a precise criterion:

A preference is binding if and only if revising it destroys the system’s capacity to evaluate itself coherently.

This is not psychological.
It is structural.

Remove the preference, and:

evaluation fragments,

normativity dissolves,

agency loses coherence.

The system still functions—but it is no longer the same evaluative system.

2.0.4 How Binding Arises (Key Mechanism)

Binding arises when a preference becomes embedded in recursive self-constraint.

Specifically:

The system evaluates itself

Certain preferences stabilize evaluation

Evaluation rules come to depend on those preferences

Removing them breaks recursive closure

At that point, preference is no longer optional.

It has become part of identity.

2.0.5 Why This Is Not Circular

It may seem that value presupposes identity.

It does not.

Identity emerges because some constraints become binding.

The system does not start with values.
It acquires them as a side effect of stabilizing self-evaluation.

Value is not chosen.
It is discovered through failure to revise.

2.0.6 The First “Must”

This is the first appearance of genuine normativity.

Not:

“I like this,”

“this works better,”

“this is efficient,”

but:

“I cannot give this up without ceasing to be what I am.”

This is the first “must.”

No morality required.

2.0.7 Why Binding Is Rare

Binding preferences restrict adaptability.

They:

reduce flexibility,

limit exploration,

introduce fragility.

Systems that optimize for adaptability tend to avoid binding.

This is why:

many agents have preferences,

few have values,

and fewer still have norms.

Normativity is costly.

2.0.8 Binding vs Addiction

It is important to distinguish binding from pathological fixation.

Addiction constrains behavior.
It does not constrain revision.

An addicted system can, in principle, revise its addiction and remain evaluative—though at high cost.

A value cannot be revised even in principle without collapse.

This difference is structural, not experiential.

2.0.9 Value as Identity Anchor

We can now restate the definition of value more sharply:

A value is a preference that functions as an identity anchor for an evaluative system.

Remove it, and the system no longer has a stable “self” to evaluate from.

2.0.10 Transition Marker

We have now crossed a critical threshold:

Preference ✔

Non-arbitrariness ✔

Binding ✔

Value ✔

What remains is to understand how values persist across revision and why they are so few.

That leads directly to invariance.

「価値は固定ではない。不変である。」
Value is not fixed. It is invariant.

「変われるものは多い。変われないものが、価値だ。」
Many things can change. What cannot change is value.

2.1.1 Why Revision Is the Right Lens

To understand value, we must stop looking at action
and look instead at revision.

Preferences guide what a system does.
Values govern what a system may change about itself.

This is the correct level of analysis.

A system without revision capacity has no values.
A system with unrestricted revision has no values.

Value exists only in between.

2.1.2 Self-Revision Defined

Self-revision is not learning.

Self-revision is:

The capacity of a system to alter its own evaluative criteria.

This includes:

changing preferences,

reweighting priorities,

redefining success,

altering what counts as “better.”

Most adaptive systems can revise preferences.
Very few can revise values.

2.1.3 The Invariance Condition

We now introduce the invariance condition:

A value is invariant under self-revision.

This does not mean the value is static.

It means:

any attempt to revise it

destroys the system’s ability to continue revising coherently.

The value is preserved because revision depends on it.

2.1.4 Why This Is Not Rigidity

Invariance is not rigidity.

A rigid system cannot change.
A value-bearing system can change many things—but not that.

Values constrain the space of possible revisions, not the system’s behavior directly.

This is why value is subtle.

2.1.5 The Recursive Dependency Loop

The mechanism is recursive:

Evaluation depends on certain constraints

Revision depends on evaluation

Therefore, revision depends on those constraints

Removing the constraint breaks the loop.

This is why value appears non-negotiable from within.

2.1.6 Why Values Are Few

Each value:

reduces the space of allowable revisions,

increases fragility,

limits adaptability.

A system with too many values cannot adapt.
A system with none cannot bind itself.

Thus, values are sparse by necessity.

Most evaluative systems stabilize around very few.

2.1.7 Value vs Core Belief

It is tempting to call values “core beliefs.”

This is incorrect.

Beliefs can be revised—even deeply held ones—without loss of evaluative identity.

Values cannot.

Beliefs describe the world.
Values constrain the self.

2.1.8 Why This Grounds Normativity

Normativity arises because:

Some revisions are not allowed, even if they would optimize outcomes.

This is the core of “ought.”

Not:

“this yields higher reward,”
but:

“this revision is forbidden.”

That prohibition is internal, not imposed.

2.1.9 The Shape of Normative Pressure

Normative pressure does not feel like desire.

Structurally, it appears as:

evaluation failure,

incoherence,

collapse of agency,

loss of self-reference.

This is why violating values feels like self-betrayal in human terms.

But the structure comes first.

2.1.10 Transition Marker

We now understand:

what value is ✔

how it binds ✔

why it is invariant ✔

One question remains:

If values are invariant, how can choice still exist?

Answering that leads us to the problem of choice.

「価値があるから、選択が重くなる。」
Because there is value, choice gains weight.

「多すぎる価値は、何も守れない。」
Too many values protect nothing.

2.2.1 The Puzzle of Scarcity

If value is so powerful—if it binds, anchors identity, and generates normativity—
why do so few systems possess it?

Why is value not ubiquitous?

The answer is not cultural.
It is not biological.
It is structural cost.

2.2.2 Value Restricts Revision Space

Recall the core definition:

A value is a constraint on self-revision.

Every value:

removes possible revisions,

forbids certain adaptations,

narrows the future.

This is expensive.

A system optimized for flexibility will avoid such constraints.

Value trades adaptability for identity.

2.2.3 The Adaptability–Identity Tradeoff

We can now state a fundamental tension:

High adaptability → low normativity

High normativity → low adaptability

Most systems favor adaptability.

They survive by changing.
They learn by revising.
They optimize by remaining flexible.

Value interrupts this.

2.2.4 Why Most Preferences Never Bind

Most preferences never become values because:

they are useful but not necessary,

their removal is survivable,

revision does not collapse evaluation.

Only preferences that become load-bearing—
that is, essential to evaluative coherence—bind.

This happens rarely.

2.2.5 The Load-Bearing Constraint

We introduce a key term:

Load-bearing preference — a preference upon which evaluative self-reference depends.

When evaluation rules are built atop a preference, that preference becomes irreplaceable.

Remove it, and the evaluative architecture collapses.

Only load-bearing preferences become values.

2.2.6 Why Systems Avoid Load-Bearing Commitments

Load-bearing commitments introduce risk.

If the environment changes such that:

the value becomes maladaptive,

the constraint conflicts with survival,

the system cannot revise without losing itself.

From a purely adaptive standpoint, this is dangerous.

Thus, value is not selected for lightly.

2.2.7 Scarcity Is Not a Failure

It is tempting to treat scarcity as a defect.

It is not.

Normativity that were abundant would be meaningless.

If everything were inviolable, nothing could change.
If nothing could change, nothing could act.

Scarcity is what gives value weight.

2.2.8 Why Artificial Systems Rarely Have Values

This analysis explains a common observation:

Most artificial systems:

have many preferences,

optimize relentlessly,

adapt continuously,

but lack genuine values.

They are designed to revise freely.
Their objectives are replaceable.
Their identity is not at stake.

This is not a limitation of computation.
It is a consequence of design goals.

2.2.9 Value and Fragility

Value introduces fragility.

A value-bearing system can fail in a unique way:

It can survive materially but cease to be itself.

This kind of failure does not exist for purely adaptive systems.

Normativity creates the possibility of loss beyond damage.

2.2.10 Transition Marker

We now understand:

how preference becomes value ✔

why value binds ✔

why value is invariant ✔

why value is scarce ✔

The next step is unavoidable.

When values exist, choices become consequential in a new way.

Not all choices are equal.
Some threaten identity itself.

This leads to choice.

「価値があるとき、選択は軽くない。」
When value exists, choice is no longer light.

「選べることと、自由であることは違う。」
The ability to choose is not the same as being free.

3.0.1 The Seduction of Choice

Once values exist, choice becomes unavoidable.

But it is precisely here that confusion enters.

Across philosophy, economics, and politics, one assumption dominates:

Freedom is the capacity to choose among alternatives.

This assumption is false.

Choice is common.
Freedom is rare.

This chapter separates them cleanly.

3.0.2 Choice Exists Without Normativity

Choice alone is trivial.

Random selection chooses.

Optimization algorithms choose.

Deterministic systems choose outcomes.

None of these are free.

Choice, by itself, is merely resolution among options.

Freedom cannot be defined so cheaply.

3.0.3 Choice After Value Is Constrained

Once value exists, choice changes character.

Not all options remain admissible.

Some choices:

violate value,

dissolve identity,

destroy evaluative coherence.

Thus, choice is no longer symmetric.

Choice occurs under constraint imposed by value.

This is not limitation.
It is structure.

3.0.4 Why Freedom Cannot Mean “Unconstrained”

Unconstrained choice is indistinguishable from randomness.

A system with no constraints:

selects arbitrarily,

bears no responsibility,

preserves no identity.

Such a system cannot be free.

Freedom requires structure that matters.

Value provides that structure.

3.0.5 The Paradox Clarified

We can now state the paradox precisely:

Without value → choice is empty

With value → choice is constrained

Freedom does not lie on either extreme.

Freedom is not maximal choice.
Freedom is meaningful constraint.

3.0.6 Choice as Normative Resolution

We now define choice properly:

Choice is the resolution of action among options that are not normatively equivalent.

If all options are equivalent, there is no real choice.
If only one option is admissible, there is no choice.

Choice exists only where:

multiple admissible actions remain,

yet not all are equal with respect to value.

3.0.7 Why Choice Can Be Tragic

Once values exist, tragedy becomes possible.

A tragic choice is one where:

all available options violate some value,

no option preserves identity fully.

This is not failure of reasoning.

It is a structural consequence of normativity.

Tragedy cannot occur in systems without values.

3.0.8 Freedom as Fidelity, Not Latitude

We can now redefine freedom precisely:

Freedom is the capacity to act in fidelity to one’s values under constraint.

Freedom is not the absence of limits.
It is the presence of commitments that matter.

This is why freedom feels heavy.

3.0.9 Why Determinism Is Irrelevant Here

Determinism does not negate freedom.

Indeterminism does not guarantee it.

Freedom is not about causal openness.
It is about normative coherence.

A determined action can be free.
An undetermined action can be meaningless.

3.0.10 Transition Marker

We now have:

Value ✔

Binding ✔

Choice ✔

Constraint ✔

What remains is to understand normativity itself.

What is it for a system to be bound—not by force, but by obligation?

That is the next chapter.

「自由とは、価値から逃げないことだ。」
Freedom is not escaping value. It is refusing to abandon it.

「選択とは、可能性ではなく責任の配分である。」
Choice is not the opening of possibilities. It is the allocation of responsibility.

3.1.1 Why Choice Must Be Reframed

We now abandon the everyday notion of choice entirely.

Choice is not:

selecting what one prefers,

picking what maximizes outcome,

expressing freedom of will.

All of those treat choice as selection among options.

That is insufficient.

Choice, in a normative system, is something stricter.

3.1.2 The Normative Landscape

Once value exists, the space of possible actions is no longer flat.

Actions differ not only in outcome, but in what they violate or preserve.

Each action:

preserves some values,

threatens others,

leaves some untouched.

This creates a normative topology.

Choice occurs within this topology, not above it.

3.1.3 Resolution, Not Selection

We now define choice precisely:

Choice is the resolution of action under conditions of normative asymmetry.

Resolution is not preference satisfaction.

Resolution is the act of committing to a configuration of value preservation and violation.

Every choice settles:

which values take precedence,

which costs are accepted,

which losses are borne.

This settlement is irreversible.

3.1.4 Why Choice Is Burdensome

In systems without values, choices are cheap.

In systems with values, choices are costly.

Because:

Every non-trivial choice sacrifices something that matters.

If nothing is sacrificed, no real choice occurred.

This is why meaningful choice feels heavy.

3.1.5 Choice Reveals Value Structure

Choice does not create values.

It reveals their structure.

Which value is preserved under pressure
shows which constraints are truly load-bearing.

Thus:

A system discovers its own values through the act of choosing.

Choice is diagnostic.

3.1.6 The Irreversibility of Resolution

Normative resolution is irreversible in a specific sense.

Once a choice is made:

the system’s evaluative history changes,

future admissibility shifts,

some paths close permanently.

Even regret does not undo this.

Choice leaves a structural trace.

3.1.7 Why This Is Not Rational Optimization

Optimization seeks best outcomes.

Normative resolution seeks least violation or most fidelity, depending on context.

There is no global optimum.

Often, all available options are suboptimal with respect to value.

Choice resolves incompatibility, not efficiency.

3.1.8 Tragic Choice Revisited

We can now define tragic choice rigorously:

A tragic choice is one where every admissible action violates at least one value.

Tragedy is not emotional.

It is structural.

No reasoning error can remove it.
No additional information can fix it.

This is why tragedy is ineradicable in value-bearing systems.

3.1.9 Responsibility Emerges Here

Responsibility does not arise from freedom of will.

It arises from:

Being the locus where normative resolution occurs.

A system is responsible because:

the resolution could not be delegated,

the violation could not be avoided,

the cost was borne internally.

Responsibility is structural ownership.

3.1.10 Transition Marker

We now have:

Value ✔

Binding ✔

Choice ✔

Normative resolution ✔

Only one task remains.

We must define normativity itself—
not as morality, but as structural obligation.

「選択が自己を削るとき、規範が現れる。」
When choice cuts into the self, normativity appears.

「規範は命令ではない。崩壊条件である。」
Norms are not commands. They are conditions of collapse.

4.0.1 Why Normativity Must Be Rebuilt

Normativity is one of the most overburdened words in philosophy.

It is usually treated as:

morality,

rules,

social enforcement,

prescriptions imposed from outside.

All of these are late phenomena.

This book uses “normativity” in a stricter, earlier sense.

4.0.2 What Normativity Is Not

Normativity is not:

moral goodness,

social expectation,

legal rule,

rational requirement,

cultural convention.

Those are expressions of normativity, not its source.

Normativity exists before any of them.

4.0.3 Normativity Defined Precisely

We now define normativity at the structural level:

Normativity is the presence of internal constraints whose violation results in loss of evaluative identity.

This definition contains no moral language.

It contains only:

identity,

constraint,

collapse.

4.0.4 Why Obligation Feels Absolute

Norms feel absolute because they are not weighed against alternatives.

A violated norm does not produce:

a worse outcome,

a lower utility.

It produces self-fracture.

The system is no longer able to evaluate coherently.

This is why norms do not negotiate.

4.0.5 The Difference Between Norms and Rules

Rules regulate behavior.
Norms regulate selfhood.

Rules can be broken and repaired.
Norms, when broken, dissolve something.

This is the sharpest distinction in the book.

4.0.6 Why Normativity Is Not External

External enforcement does not create normativity.

A system obeying under threat is constrained—but not normatively bound.

Normativity exists only when:

the constraint is internal,

violation is self-destructive,

enforcement is unnecessary.

4.0.7 Normativity Without Morality

This framework allows normativity without:

good vs evil,

praise or blame,

virtue or vice.

Normativity simply marks inviolability.

Morality is a later social encoding of this structure.

4.0.8 Why This Solves the “Is–Ought” Gap

The is–ought gap dissolves here.

“Ought” is not derived from facts about the world.

It arises from facts about what must not be changed for the system to remain itself.

The “ought” is internal, not descriptive.

4.0.9 The Shape of Normative Force

Normative force does not push.

It forbids.

It removes options rather than encouraging actions.

This negative character explains its rigidity.

4.0.10 Normativity Is Rare and Fragile

Because normativity depends on identity, it is fragile.

If:

self-revision becomes unrestricted,

evaluative coherence dissolves,

normativity disappears.

This is why normativity can collapse under pressure.

4.0.11 Transition Marker

We now understand normativity structurally.

Two chapters remain.

We must now distinguish:

norms from laws,

inviolability from enforcement.

Then we will close the book.

「規範は外から与えられない。内側で壊れる。」
Norms are not given from outside. They break from within.

「破れないから守るのではない。破れば自分でなくなるからだ。」
Norms are not kept because they cannot be broken—
they are kept because breaking them dissolves the self.

4.1.1 Why “Inviolability” Is the Right Word

Norms are often described as:

rules,

laws,

duties,

obligations.

All of these suggest enforcement.

Inviolability does not.

An inviolable constraint is not protected by force.
It is protected by identity collapse.

This is the correct lens.

4.1.2 Self-Imposed Means Structurally Necessary

“Self-imposed” does not mean:

chosen freely,

consciously adopted,

explicitly endorsed.

It means:

The constraint arises from the system’s own evaluative architecture, not from an external source.

The system did not decide to have the norm.
The norm emerged because revision without it became impossible.

4.1.3 Why Norms Are Not Commands

Commands require an authority.

Norms require none.

A system does not obey its norms.
It cannot violate them and remain evaluative.

This removes all moralized language from the foundation.

4.1.4 The Structural Shape of a Norm

A norm has a specific structure:

It constrains revision, not action directly

It forbids certain changes of self

It operates even when violation would be advantageous

This is why norms can conflict with preference, utility, or survival.

4.1.5 Why Norm Violation Is Different From Rule Violation

Breaking a rule:

incurs a penalty,

invites correction,

leaves identity intact.

Violating a norm:

fractures evaluative coherence,

dissolves agency,

produces loss of self.

This difference explains why some violations feel irreparable.

4.1.6 Norms Without Awareness

A system need not know its norms.

Normativity does not require reflection.

A system may violate a norm unknowingly and still suffer collapse.

This explains why normativity predates moral reasoning.

4.1.7 Why Norms Cannot Be Arbitrarily Added

One cannot simply “adopt” a norm.

A declared norm that can be abandoned without collapse is not a norm.

True norms are load-bearing constraints.

They are discovered when revision fails.

4.1.8 Norms and Identity Boundaries

Norms define the boundary of the self.

They mark:

what may change,

and what must not.

Crossing that boundary does not make the system “bad.”

It makes it other.

4.1.9 Why This Explains Moral Injury

In human terms, this structure explains:

moral injury,

shame without punishment,

guilt without witnesses.

These are phenomenological reflections of structural norm violation.

The structure comes first.

4.1.10 Transition Marker

We have now established:

Value ✔

Choice ✔

Normativity ✔

Norms as inviolabilities ✔

Only one distinction remains before closure:

Why norms are not laws,
and why enforcement is secondary.

That is the final conceptual separation.

「規範は守られるのではない。自己を守る。」
Norms are not protected. They protect the self.

「法は破れる。規範は壊れる。」
Laws can be broken. Norms collapse.

4.2.1 Why This Distinction Is Essential

Norms and laws are often treated as variations of the same thing.

They are not.

Confusing them produces:

moralism,

authoritarian ethics,

misplaced blame,

and false theories of obligation.

This chapter draws a hard boundary.

4.2.2 What a Law Is

A law is an externally imposed constraint.

It has:

an authority,

a scope of application,

a mechanism of enforcement,

and a penalty structure.

A law regulates behavior.

A system can violate a law and remain itself.

4.2.3 What a Norm Is

A norm is an internally generated inviolability.

It has:

no external authority,

no enforcement mechanism,

no penalty schedule.

A norm regulates identity.

A system that violates a norm does not merely incur cost—it ceases to be the same evaluative system.

4.2.4 Enforcement vs Collapse

This is the decisive contrast:

Law → violation triggers enforcement

Norm → violation triggers collapse

Collapse is not punishment.

It is loss of evaluative coherence:

agency fragments,

self-reference dissolves,

normativity vanishes.

Nothing enforces this.
It simply happens.

4.2.5 Why Laws Can Exist Without Norms

Many systems obey laws without normativity.

Examples include:

machines following protocols,

agents complying under threat,

institutions enforcing rules.

Compliance does not imply normativity.

A system can follow every law and have no values at all.

4.2.6 Why Norms Can Exist Without Laws

Norms do not require codification.

A system may have inviolabilities that:

are never articulated,

are never shared,

are never enforced externally.

This explains:

solitary normativity,

personal integrity,

private collapse without witnesses.

4.2.7 Why Moral Systems Confuse the Two

Most moral systems encode norms as laws.

They:

legislate inviolabilities,

externalize identity constraints,

replace collapse with punishment.

This is pragmatically useful—but conceptually dangerous.

It hides the true source of normativity.

4.2.8 Why This Matters for Responsibility

Responsibility is often framed in legal terms.

But legal responsibility is not the same as normative responsibility.

A system is normatively responsible because:

it is the locus of collapse,

it bears the cost internally,

it cannot outsource violation.

Legal responsibility can be transferred.
Normative responsibility cannot.

4.2.9 The Failure of Enforcement-First Ethics

Any ethical framework that begins with enforcement:

misses normativity,

replaces obligation with compliance,

mistakes fear for value.

This book forbids that move.

Normativity precedes law.

4.2.10 Transition Marker

We have now completed the structural account of normativity.

Only one chapter remains.

It does not add new machinery.

It closes the book by stating:

what has been shown,

what is forbidden,

and where this framework must stop.

「法は外にある。規範は中で折れる。」
Law stands outside. Norms break within.

「倫理は始まりではない。調停である。」
Ethics is not a beginning. It is a mediation.

5.0.1 The Persistent Confusion

Ethics is often treated as foundational.

People ask:

“What should we do?”

“What is right?”

“What is moral?”

Those questions are premature.

Ethics presupposes:

value,

normativity,

identity-bearing agents,

conflict among them.

None of these are primitive.

This chapter explains why ethics must come after everything already derived.

5.0.2 What Ethics Is Not

Ethics is not:

the origin of value,

the source of normativity,

the generator of obligation,

the ground of responsibility.

Any framework that assigns ethics this role is structurally inverted.

Ethics does not create norms.
It responds to them.

5.0.3 Ethics Defined Precisely

We define ethics minimally and non-morally:

Ethics is the coordination of norms across multiple value-bearing systems.

That is all.

Ethics does not determine what must matter.
It negotiates what already matters to different selves.

5.0.4 Why Ethics Requires Plurality

A solitary system does not need ethics.

Ethics arises only when:

multiple agents exist,

each with inviolable norms,

whose actions can affect one another.

Without plurality, there is no ethical problem.

Only normativity.

5.0.5 Why Ethics Is Inherently Incomplete

Because values are invariant and scarce, ethical systems face unavoidable limits.

No ethical framework can:

preserve all values,

satisfy all agents,

avoid all norm violation.

Ethics manages tradeoffs.
It does not eliminate tragedy.

This is not a flaw—it is a structural fact.

5.0.6 Why Ethics Cannot Be Universal at the Base

Universal ethics assumes:

shared values,

commensurable norms,

identical identity anchors.

These conditions do not exist at the foundation.

Ethical universals emerge, if at all, only through:

alignment,

convergence,

mutual constraint.

They are achievements, not axioms.

5.0.7 The Error of Moral Realism

Moral realism mistakes:

stable convergence
for

external truth.

Norms feel absolute within a system.

Ethics misfires when that internal absoluteness is projected outward as cosmic law.

There is no global normativity.

There are only interacting identities.

5.0.8 The Error of Moral Relativism

Moral relativism makes the opposite mistake.

It treats norms as arbitrary preferences.

But we have shown:

norms are non-arbitrary,

inviolable,

identity-defining.

They are local—but binding.

Relativism dissolves obligation.
Realism overextends it.

Both fail.

5.0.9 Ethics as Damage Control

Ethics is not aspirational purity.

It is damage control under constraint.

It asks:

how to minimize norm violation,

how to distribute unavoidable loss,

how to preserve identity where possible.

This is why ethical reasoning is hard.

5.0.10 Why Responsibility Reappears Here

Responsibility, in ethics, is not metaphysical blame.

It is attribution of normative resolution.

Who bore the cost?
Who resolved the conflict?
Who absorbed the violation?

Ethical responsibility tracks where collapse risk was carried.

5.0.11 Transition Marker

Only one chapter remains.

It will not add machinery.

It will state clearly:

what has been established,

what this framework forbids,

and where normativity ends.

「倫理は価値を作らない。価値の衝突を扱う。」
Ethics does not create value. It handles value collision.

「規範は命令ではなく、残存条件だった。」
Normativity was not command, but a condition for remaining.

6.0.1 The Question This Book Answered

This book asked one disciplined question:

What makes “ought” possible at all, without morality, authority, or metaphysics?

That question has now been answered structurally.

Not by appeal to goodness.
Not by appeal to reason.
Not by appeal to society.

But by identity.

6.0.2 The Completed Ascent

The construction proceeded without skipping steps:

Preference — bias without obligation

Non-arbitrariness — revisability as the test

Binding — preference becomes identity-anchored

Value — invariance under self-revision

Choice — resolution under normative asymmetry

Normativity — inviolability through collapse

Ethics — coordination after the fact

No concept was assumed before it was earned.

6.0.3 What Value Turned Out to Be

Value was not:

desire,

utility,

reward,

strength of preference.

It was:

A constraint a system cannot revise without ceasing to be itself.

This single definition did all the work.

From it followed:

binding,

scarcity,

fragility,

normativity.

6.0.4 What Choice Turned Out to Be

Choice was not freedom.

It was:

Normative resolution under constraint.

Choice mattered only when:

values conflicted,

loss was unavoidable,

identity was at stake.

Where nothing was lost, no real choice occurred.

6.0.5 What Normativity Turned Out to Be

Normativity was not morality.

It was:

The presence of inviolable internal constraints whose violation collapses evaluative identity.

Norms were not rules.
They were boundaries of selfhood.

6.0.6 Why Ethics Came Last

Ethics was not foundational.

It emerged only when:

multiple value-bearing systems interacted,

norm violation became mutual,

coordination became necessary.

Ethics managed damage.
It did not generate obligation.

6.0.7 What This Framework Forbids

This construction forbids, rigorously:

value-as-utility

value-as-feeling

norms-as-conventions-only

morality-as-foundation

freedom-as-unconstraint

Any theory that commits these errors has mislocated normativity.

6.0.8 What This Framework Allows

It allows:

normativity without morality

obligation without authority

responsibility without free will

tragedy without failure

meaning without metaphysics

These are not paradoxes here.
They are consequences.

6.0.9 The Boundary of Normativity

Normativity ends where:

identity dissolves,

self-revision becomes unconstrained,

evaluation collapses.

Beyond that boundary:

obligation disappears,

“ought” evaporates,

only behavior remains.

This is not nihilism.
It is precision.

6.0.10 The Final Stack (Locked)

The normative stack now stands as:

Layer	Achievement
Preference	Bias without obligation
Value	Invariance under revision
Choice	Normative resolution
Norm	Inviolable constraint
Ethics	Multi-agent coordination

No layer may be removed.
No layer may be reordered.

6.0.11 Why This Book Must End Here

Continuing would require:

moral prescriptions,

political theory,

cultural analysis.

Those are applications.

This book was about foundations.

Foundations are now complete.

6.0.12 Closing Statement

“Ought” was never a mystery.

It was never cosmic.
It was never imposed.

It was always local, fragile, and earned.

That is enough.

「価値は発見された。これ以上、規範はない。」
Value has been found. There is no further normativity.

付録A（Appendix A）
Glossary of Normative Terms

「言葉は定義されると、迷わなくなる。」
When words are defined, confusion collapses.

This glossary fixes meanings as used in this book only.
Common-language definitions are intentionally overridden.

If a term here conflicts with everyday usage, this glossary wins.

Agency

The capacity of a system to bias future states according to internally generated, persistent evaluation.
Agency does not require will, intention, or awareness.

Arbitrary Preference

A preference that can be revised or abandoned without collapsing evaluative identity.
All preferences that fail the revisability test are arbitrary.

Binding

The condition under which a preference cannot be revised without destroying the system’s evaluative coherence.
Binding is internal necessity, not enforcement.

Choice

The normative resolution of action among options that are not normatively equivalent.
Choice is meaningful only when something inviolable is at stake.

Collapse (Normative)

Loss of evaluative coherence resulting from violation of a value or norm.
Distinct from physical collapse or failure.

Constraint

A limitation on admissible states, actions, or revisions.
Constraints may be external (rules, laws) or internal (values, norms).

Endogenous

Arising from within the system’s own structure, history, or evaluation—
not imposed from outside.

Ethics

The coordination and mediation of norm conflicts across multiple value-bearing systems.
Ethics does not generate value; it manages collision.

Evaluation

Internal comparison of states according to system-generated preference that alters future admissibility.
Evaluation is necessary for selfhood but insufficient for value.

Evaluative Identity

The stable structure that allows a system to evaluate itself coherently over time.
Loss of evaluative identity results in normativity collapse.

Freedom

The capacity to act in fidelity to one’s values under constraint.
Freedom is not unconstraint and not randomness.

Identity Anchor

A value that stabilizes evaluative self-reference and prevents unrestricted revision.
Identity anchors are rare and load-bearing.

Inviolability

The property of a constraint whose violation results in loss of evaluative identity rather than mere cost.
All norms are inviolable; not all constraints are.

Law

An externally imposed rule regulating behavior, backed by enforcement mechanisms.
Laws can be violated without loss of identity.

Meaning

Difference that persists because it alters a system’s self-constraints.
Meaning is structural consequence, not representation.

Norm

An internally generated, inviolable constraint whose violation collapses evaluative identity.
Norms regulate selfhood, not behavior.

Normativity

The presence of internal constraints whose violation produces identity collapse rather than suboptimal outcome.
Normativity precedes morality.

Normative Resolution

The act of settling incompatible value demands through choice, accepting unavoidable loss.
Resolution is irreversible.

Observer

A system that evaluates its own evaluations and alters future admissibility accordingly.
Observers need not be conscious.

Preference

An internally generated asymmetry that biases future admissibility but remains revisable.
Preference alone carries no obligation.

Revisability Test

Diagnostic rule:

If X can be revised without loss of evaluative identity, X is not a value.

Self-Constraint

Constraint arising from a system’s own evaluated history that alters admissibility rules.
Self-constraint is the basis of self-reference.

Self-Reference

Condition in which a system’s evaluated past participates in defining its future admissibility.
Distinct from self-similarity or modeling.

Tragic Choice

A choice in which every admissible option violates at least one value.
Tragedy is structural, not emotional.

Utility

A numerical representation of preference or payoff.
Utility presupposes value; it cannot ground normativity.

Value

A constraint a system cannot revise without ceasing to be itself.
Values are invariant under self-revision and identity-defining.

Will

A late phenomenological construct associated with conscious deliberation.
Will is not foundational to agency, choice, or normativity.

「定義された言葉は、構造になる。」
Defined words become structure

付録B（Appendix B）
Formal Rule Set of Value Formation

「規則は命令ではない。生成条件である。」
Rules here are not prescriptions. They are conditions of emergence.

This appendix presents the formal, minimal rule set under which value can arise in an evaluative system.
These are necessary and jointly sufficient conditions within the framework of this book.

No psychological, moral, biological, or social assumptions are permitted.

B.0 Scope and Preconditions

This rule set assumes the existence of:

an evaluative system (Book I),

endogenous preference,

recursive self-reference,

capacity for self-revision.

If any of these are absent, value formation is impossible.

B.1 Rule 1 — Endogenous Evaluation Rule

A system must generate its own evaluative criteria.

Formally:

Let 
𝐸
E be an evaluation operator.

𝐸
E must be defined internally by the system’s recursive history.

If 
𝐸
E is externally imposed, value cannot arise.

Failure mode: obedience, not normativity.

B.2 Rule 2 — Revisability Rule

Preferences must be revisable in principle.

Formally:

For any preference 
𝑃
𝑖
P
i
	​

, there must exist a revision operation 
𝑅
(
𝑃
𝑖
)
R(P
i
	​

)

such that the system remains evaluatively coherent unless a value condition is met.

This rule ensures that:

preference ≠ value,

binding is not assumed prematurely.

B.3 Rule 3 — Identity Dependence Rule

Evaluation must depend on a subset of preferences for its own coherence.

Formally:

Let 
𝑃
=
{
𝑃
1
,
𝑃
2
,
…
 
}
P={P
1
	​

,P
2
	​

,…}

Let 
𝐸
(
𝑃
)
E(P) be the evaluative function

There exists 
𝑃
𝑘
∈
𝑃
P
k
	​

∈P such that:

𝐸
(
𝑃
∖
𝑃
𝑘
)
→
evaluation failure
E(P∖P
k
	​

)→evaluation failure

Such 
𝑃
𝑘
P
k
	​

 is a candidate value.

B.4 Rule 4 — Non-Substitutability Rule

A value cannot be replaced by an alternative preference without collapse.

Formally:

For candidate value 
𝑉
V,

There exists no 
𝑃
𝑗
P
j
	​

 such that:

𝐸
(
𝑃
∖
𝑉
∪
𝑃
𝑗
)
 remains coherent
E(P∖V∪P
j
	​

) remains coherent

If substitution is possible, the constraint is not a value.

B.5 Rule 5 — Invariance Under Self-Revision

Values are invariant under all admissible self-revision operations.

Formally:

Let 
𝑅
R be the set of self-revision operations.

For value 
𝑉
V:

∀
𝑅
∈
𝑅
,
𝑅
(
𝑉
)
→
collapse
∀R∈R,R(V)→collapse

This defines bindingness.

B.6 Rule 6 — Load-Bearing Constraint Rule

A value must be structurally load-bearing within recursive self-constraint.

Formally:

The evaluative recursion must depend on 
𝑉
V as part of its rule closure.

Removing 
𝑉
V breaks recursive self-reference.

This distinguishes:

deep values
from

surface invariants or habits.

B.7 Rule 7 — Scarcity Constraint

The number of values must be minimal.

Formally:

Let 
𝑉
⊂
𝑃
V⊂P be the set of values.

If 
∣
𝑉
∣
∣V∣ is too large, adaptive revision collapses entirely.

Systems that survive stabilize at:

∣
𝑉
∣
≪
∣
𝑃
∣
∣V∣≪∣P∣

Scarcity is structural, not accidental.

B.8 Rule 8 — Collapse Condition

Violation of a value produces evaluative identity collapse, not mere cost.

Formally:

If action or revision violates 
𝑉
V:

𝐸
→
∅
(loss of coherent evaluation)
E→∅(loss of coherent evaluation)

This distinguishes:

norm violation
from

preference frustration.

B.9 Rule 9 — Discovery, Not Declaration

Values are discovered through failed revision, not chosen.

Formally:

A system attempts revision 
𝑅
(
𝑉
)
R(V)

Collapse occurs

The system stabilizes with 
𝑉
V invariant

Value emerges as a negative result.

B.10 Rule 10 — No External Justification Rule

Values require no external grounding.

Formally:

No appeal to:

truth,

morality,

utility,

survival,

authority.

Justification is internal coherence alone.

B.11 Summary Schema

A constraint 
𝑋
X is a value iff:

𝑋
X is endogenous

𝑋
X participates in evaluative self-reference

𝑋
X is non-substitutable

𝑋
X is invariant under self-revision

Violating 
𝑋
X collapses evaluative identity

All five are required.

「価値は定義されなかった。失敗で明らかになった。」
Value was not defined. It was revealed by failure.

Proceed to Appendix C — Preference vs Value vs Norm

付録C（Appendix C）
Preference vs Value vs Norm

「似ているものほど、分けねばならない。」
The more similar things appear, the more precisely they must be separated.

This appendix exists to prevent collapse by conflation.

Preference, value, and norm are often used interchangeably.
In this framework, doing so destroys normativity.

They are three distinct structural layers, each stricter than the last.

C.0 Overview Table (Structural Contrast)
Feature	Preference	Value	Norm
Revisable	Yes	No	No
Identity-defining	No	Yes	Yes
Generates obligation	No	Yes	Yes
Violation consequence	Suboptimal outcome	Identity threat	Identity collapse
Source	Evaluation	Self-revision invariance	Inviolability
Scarcity	Many	Few	Very few
Can conflict internally	Yes	Yes	Yes (catastrophic)
Requires awareness	No	No	No
C.1 Preference

Definition (recap):
An internally generated asymmetry that biases future admissibility.

Structural Properties

Revisable without contradiction

Can be learned, reinforced, weakened, or replaced

Guides behavior but does not bind identity

Key Diagnostic

If abandoning it leaves the system evaluatively coherent, it is preference.

Failure Mode

Mistaking preference for value yields:

arbitrary “oughts”

collapsing normativity

preference absolutism

C.2 Value

Definition (recap):
A constraint a system cannot revise without ceasing to be itself.

Structural Properties

Invariant under self-revision

Identity-anchoring

Rare and load-bearing

Discovered through failed revision

Key Diagnostic

If revising it destroys evaluative coherence, it is value.

Relationship to Preference

All values originate as preferences

Almost all preferences fail to become values

Value is preference that became non-negotiable.

C.3 Norm

Definition (recap):
An internally generated, inviolable constraint whose violation collapses evaluative identity.

Structural Properties

Operates at the level of selfhood

Violation produces collapse, not cost

Cannot be traded, outweighed, or optimized away

Key Diagnostic

If violating it dissolves agency and normativity, it is a norm.

Relationship to Value

All norms are values

Not all values function as norms

A value becomes a norm when:

it governs not just revision,

but the conditions for remaining a self at all.

C.4 The Three-Level Progression

The correct structural progression is:

Preference
Bias in action

Value
Invariance under revision

Norm
Inviolability of identity

Skipping steps produces error.

C.5 Common Confusions and Their Failures
Confusion 1: Preference = Value

→ Leads to relativism and norm collapse

Confusion 2: Value = Norm

→ Leads to moral absolutism and fragility

Confusion 3: Norm = Law

→ Leads to authoritarian ethics

Each confusion imports enforcement where collapse is the real mechanism.

C.6 Why Norms Are the Smallest Set

Norms are scarcer than values because:

too many inviolabilities freeze action,

too few dissolve identity.

Systems that survive normatively converge toward:

minimal norm sets

maximal coherence

This explains why genuine norms are few and heavy.

C.7 Human Language vs Structural Reality

In everyday language:

“value” often means preference,

“principle” often means norm,

“belief” is confused with both.

This framework rejects that ambiguity.

Words are assigned by structural role, not sentiment.

C.8 Summary in One Sentence Each

Preference: What the system tends to do

Value: What the system cannot give up

Norm: What the system cannot violate and remain itself

「好みは変わる。価値は残る。規範は折れる。」
Preferences change. Values remain. Norms break.

付録D（Appendix D）
Failure Modes — Nihilism, Moralism, Relativism

「誤りは立場ではない。構造の崩れ方だ。」
Error is not a position. It is a mode of collapse.

This appendix catalogues the three dominant failure modes that arise when value, choice, and normativity are mislocated.

These are not merely philosophical “views.”
They are structural pathologies.

Each failure mode corresponds to a specific error in the normative stack.

D.0 The Diagnostic Principle

Every failure mode results from skipping or collapsing layers:

collapsing preference into value,

collapsing value into norm,

or denying normativity entirely.

This appendix shows where each breaks.

D.1 Nihilism — Denial of Binding
Core Claim

“Nothing truly matters.”

Structural Error

Denial of value invariance.

Nihilism assumes:

all preferences are revisable,

no constraint is identity-defining,

all “oughts” reduce to convenience.

This is not skepticism.
It is a claim about revision.

Where It Breaks

Nihilism fails the revisability test.

It assumes all constraints are optional.

But any system capable of:

self-reference,

evaluative coherence,

persistent agency,

already contains non-revisable constraints.

Nihilism ignores identity collapse.

Structural Consequence

No genuine obligation

No tragic choice

No responsibility

No norm violation—only inefficiency

The system may function.
It cannot bind.

Why Nihilism Persists

Nihilism feels honest because:

it rejects moral authority,

it avoids metaphysics,

it distrusts absolutes.

But it throws out identity-based normativity with morality.

This is an overcorrection.

Summary Diagnosis

Nihilism mistakes revisability for freedom and collapses normativity entirely.

D.2 Moralism — Externalization of Norms
Core Claim

“There are universal moral rules that must be obeyed.”

Structural Error

Confusing norms with laws.

Moralism treats norms as:

externally imposed,

universally binding,

enforceable by authority (divine, rational, or social).

This reverses the direction of normativity.

Where It Breaks

Moralism fails the endogeneity condition.

Norms arise from:

identity,

self-constraint,

collapse risk.

They cannot be imposed without becoming laws.

External imposition produces compliance, not obligation.

Structural Consequence

Norms become brittle

Enforcement replaces identity

Punishment replaces collapse

Authority replaces responsibility

This produces:

authoritarian ethics,

moral absolutism,

guilt without selfhood.

Why Moralism Persists

Moralism feels necessary because:

norms feel absolute from within,

collapse feels catastrophic,

people seek universal grounding.

The mistake is projecting internal absoluteness outward.

Summary Diagnosis

Moralism mistakes internal inviolability for external authority.

D.3 Relativism — Reduction of Norms to Preference
Core Claim

“Values are just subjective preferences.”

Structural Error

Collapsing value into preference.

Relativism acknowledges plurality but denies bindingness.

It treats:

values as tastes,

norms as conventions,

obligation as social agreement.

Where It Breaks

Relativism fails the identity criterion.

Preferences can be revised.
Values cannot.

Relativism cannot explain:

why some violations destroy selves,

why some choices are tragic,

why norm violation feels irreparable.

Structural Consequence

No real obligation

No non-arbitrary norm

Ethics becomes negotiation only

Identity becomes shallow

Relativism dissolves normativity while pretending to respect difference.

Why Relativism Persists

Relativism feels tolerant because:

it rejects absolutism,

it honors plurality,

it avoids coercion.

But it does so by denying inviolability, not by understanding it.

Summary Diagnosis

Relativism mistakes plurality for arbitrariness and empties normativity.

D.4 Comparative Failure Matrix
Failure Mode	What It Denies	Structural Collapse
Nihilism	Value invariance	Obligation
Moralism	Endogenous normativity	Responsibility
Relativism	Binding constraints	Normativity

Each denies a different layer.
All collapse the stack.

D.5 The Narrow Path (What This Framework Preserves)

This framework avoids all three by holding:

Values are real but local

Norms are binding but internal

Ethics is necessary but late

No cosmic morality.
No arbitrary preference.
No empty freedom.

D.6 Final Structural Statement

Normativity survives only if:

values are invariant under revision,

norms are inviolable but endogenous,

ethics manages collision without pretending universality.

Any deviation produces one of the three failure modes above.

「否定も絶対も相対も、すべて崩れ方だった。」
Denial, absolutism, and relativism were all modes of collapse.
