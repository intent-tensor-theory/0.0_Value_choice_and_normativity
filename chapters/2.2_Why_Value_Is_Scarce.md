## Why Value Is Scarce

---

「価値があるとき、選択は軽くない。」  
*When value exists, choice is no longer light.*

---

### 2.2.1 The Puzzle of Scarcity

If value is so powerful—if it binds, anchors identity, and generates normativity—why do so few systems possess it?

Why is value not ubiquitous?

The answer is not cultural.  
It is not biological.  
**It is structural cost.**

---

### 2.2.2 Value Restricts Revision Space

Recall the core definition:

> A value is a constraint on self-revision.

Every value:

- removes possible revisions,
- forbids certain adaptations,
- narrows the future.

This is expensive.

A system optimized for flexibility will avoid such constraints.

**Value trades adaptability for identity.**

---

### 2.2.3 The Adaptability–Identity Tradeoff

We can now state a fundamental tension:

- High adaptability → low normativity
- High normativity → low adaptability

Most systems favor adaptability.

They survive by changing.  
They learn by revising.  
They optimize by remaining flexible.

**Value interrupts this.**

---

### 2.2.4 Why Most Preferences Never Bind

Most preferences never become values because:

- they are useful but not necessary,
- their removal is survivable,
- revision does not collapse evaluation.

Only preferences that become **load-bearing**—that is, essential to evaluative coherence—bind.

This happens rarely.

---

### 2.2.5 The Load-Bearing Constraint

We introduce a key term:

> **Load-bearing preference** — a preference upon which evaluative self-reference depends.

When evaluation rules are built atop a preference, that preference becomes irreplaceable.

Remove it, and the evaluative architecture collapses.

**Only load-bearing preferences become values.**

---

### 2.2.6 Why Systems Avoid Load-Bearing Commitments

Load-bearing commitments introduce risk.

If the environment changes such that:

- the value becomes maladaptive,
- the constraint conflicts with survival,
- the system cannot revise without losing itself.

From a purely adaptive standpoint, this is dangerous.

**Thus, value is not selected for lightly.**

---

### 2.2.7 Scarcity Is Not a Failure

It is tempting to treat scarcity as a defect.

It is not.

Normativity that were abundant would be meaningless.

If everything were inviolable, nothing could change.  
If nothing could change, nothing could act.

**Scarcity is what gives value weight.**

---

### 2.2.8 Why Artificial Systems Rarely Have Values

This analysis explains a common observation:

Most artificial systems:

- have many preferences,
- optimize relentlessly,
- adapt continuously,
- but lack genuine values.

They are designed to revise freely.  
Their objectives are replaceable.  
Their identity is not at stake.

This is not a limitation of computation.  
**It is a consequence of design goals.**

---

### 2.2.9 Value and Fragility

Value introduces fragility.

A value-bearing system can fail in a unique way:

> It can survive materially but cease to be itself.

This kind of failure does not exist for purely adaptive systems.

**Normativity creates the possibility of loss beyond damage.**

---

### 2.2.10 Transition Marker

We now understand:

- how preference becomes value ✔
- why value binds ✔
- why value is invariant ✔
- why value is scarce ✔

The next step is unavoidable.

When values exist, choices become consequential in a new way.

Not all choices are equal.  
**Some threaten identity itself.**

This leads to choice.

---

「選べることと、自由であることは違う。」  
*The ability to choose is not the same as being free.*
