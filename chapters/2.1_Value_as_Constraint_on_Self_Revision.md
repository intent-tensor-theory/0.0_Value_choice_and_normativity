## Value as Constraint on Self-Revision

---

「価値があるから、選択が重くなる。」  
*Because there is value, choice gains weight.*

---

### 2.1.1 Why Revision Is the Right Lens

To understand value, we must stop looking at action and look instead at **revision**.

Preferences guide what a system does.  
Values govern what a system may **change about itself**.

This is the correct level of analysis.

A system without revision capacity has no values.  
A system with unrestricted revision has no values.

**Value exists only in between.**

---

### 2.1.2 Self-Revision Defined

Self-revision is not learning.

Self-revision is:

> The capacity of a system to alter its own evaluative criteria.

This includes:

- changing preferences,
- reweighting priorities,
- redefining success,
- altering what counts as "better."

Most adaptive systems can revise preferences.  
Very few can revise values.

---

### 2.1.3 The Invariance Condition

We now introduce the invariance condition:

> **A value is invariant under self-revision.**

This does not mean the value is static.

It means:

- any attempt to revise it
- destroys the system's ability to continue revising coherently.

The value is preserved because **revision depends on it**.

---

### 2.1.4 Why This Is Not Rigidity

Invariance is not rigidity.

A rigid system cannot change.  
A value-bearing system can change many things—but not *that*.

Values constrain the space of possible revisions, not the system's behavior directly.

This is why value is subtle.

---

### 2.1.5 The Recursive Dependency Loop

The mechanism is recursive:

1. Evaluation depends on certain constraints
2. Revision depends on evaluation
3. Therefore, revision depends on those constraints

Removing the constraint breaks the loop.

This is why value appears non-negotiable from within.

---

### 2.1.6 Why Values Are Few

Each value:

- reduces the space of allowable revisions,
- increases fragility,
- limits adaptability.

A system with too many values cannot adapt.  
A system with none cannot bind itself.

**Thus, values are sparse by necessity.**

Most evaluative systems stabilize around very few.

---

### 2.1.7 Value vs Core Belief

It is tempting to call values "core beliefs."

This is incorrect.

Beliefs can be revised—even deeply held ones—without loss of evaluative identity.

Values cannot.

Beliefs describe the world.  
**Values constrain the self.**

---

### 2.1.8 Why This Grounds Normativity

Normativity arises because:

> Some revisions are not allowed, even if they would optimize outcomes.

This is the core of "ought."

Not:

"this yields higher reward,"

but:

**"this revision is forbidden."**

That prohibition is internal, not imposed.

---

### 2.1.9 The Shape of Normative Pressure

Normative pressure does not feel like desire.

Structurally, it appears as:

- evaluation failure,
- incoherence,
- collapse of agency,
- loss of self-reference.

This is why violating values feels like self-betrayal in human terms.

**But the structure comes first.**

---

### 2.1.10 Transition Marker

We now understand:

- what value is ✔
- how it binds ✔
- why it is invariant ✔

One question remains:

If values are invariant, **how can choice still exist?**

Answering that leads us to the problem of choice.

「多すぎる価値は、何も守れない。」  
*Too many values protect nothing.*
