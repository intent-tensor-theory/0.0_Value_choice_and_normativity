## How to Read This Book

---

### 0.1.1 Why Moral Language Is Forbidden Early

This book deals with normativity—the domain of "ought."

But moral language is dangerous.

Words like:

- good / bad
- right / wrong
- virtue / vice
- duty / sin

carry conclusions inside them.

If we use them too early, we assume what we must derive.

Until Chapter 4.0, such language is **forbidden**.

If such words appear, they are shorthand and must translate into structural terms.

---

### 0.1.2 Why Examples Are Dangerous

Examples invite intuition.

Intuition smuggles in:

- cultural assumptions,
- emotional reactions,
- unstated moral frameworks.

This book avoids examples until the structural work is done.

When examples appear later, they are **illustrations**, not foundations.

---

### 0.1.3 Why Neutrality Must Be Preserved

This book does not advocate for any moral position.

It does not say:

- "you should care about X,"
- "this value is better than that one,"
- "here is how to live."

It says only:

> "If obligation exists at all, here is what it must be."

Neutrality is not evasion.

It is discipline.

---

### 0.1.4 Reading Order

The book must be read in order.

Each chapter depends on what came before.

Skipping to "ethics" or "choice" without the preceding derivation produces nonsense.

The structure is:

1. **Preference** (what biases)
2. **Value** (what binds)
3. **Choice** (what resolves)
4. **Normativity** (what forbids)
5. **Ethics** (what coordinates)

No step may be omitted.

### 0.1.5 What Success Looks Like

At the end of this book, the reader should be able to:

- distinguish preference from value,
- distinguish value from norm,
- distinguish normativity from morality,
- and know exactly where formal explanation must stop.

If these distinctions remain blurred, the reading has failed.
