## Preface — Why Value Is Not Preference

**Progress: 16.7%**

---

「好みは揺れる。価値は残る。」  
*Preferences fluctuate. Values remain.*

---

### 0.0.1 The Third Silence

After space is earned, and after selves are constructed, a deeper silence appears.

Systems now:

- evaluate themselves,
- act with agency,
- even observe their own evaluations.

And yet—something is still missing.

They can act.  
They can prefer.  
They can choose.

But none of that explains why some choices bind.

This book begins in that silence.

---

### 0.0.2 The Common Mistake

Across philosophy, economics, AI, and ethics, one assumption is repeated:

> Value is a strong preference.

This assumption is false.

Preference explains what a system tends to do.  
Value explains what a system **must not abandon**.

Conflating the two dissolves normativity entirely.

---

### 0.0.3 Why Preference Is Too Weak

From Book I, we already have preference:

- endogenous,
- persistent,
- self-modifying.

Yet preference alone fails.

A system may:

- prefer X today,
- prefer not-X tomorrow,
- revise its biases repeatedly—

and remain perfectly coherent.

**Preference can be discarded without contradiction.**

**Value cannot.**

This difference is structural, not emotional.

---

### 0.0.4 What "Value" Will Mean Here

We define value narrowly and without moral language:

> **A value is a constraint a system cannot revise without undermining its own evaluative identity.**

This definition has three consequences:

1. Values are **rare**
2. Values are **binding**
3. Values are **identity-defining**

Anything that can be revised without loss of self is not a value.

---

### 0.0.5 Why This Is Not Ethics (Yet)

Ethics presupposes:

- multiple agents,
- shared norms,
- accountability,
- conflict resolution.

None of these are assumed here.

This book operates **before** ethics.

It asks:

- what makes normativity possible at all,
- not how it should be applied.

Ethics is a later alignment problem.

---

### 0.0.6 Why Utility Fails at the Start

Utility-based frameworks treat value as:

- maximization,
- aggregation,
- numerical comparison.

But maximization requires:

- a fixed scale,
- commensurable options,
- externally defined payoff.

None of these exist at the foundation.

> Utility assumes value.  
> It does not explain it.

---

### 0.0.7 The Binding Problem

The central problem of this book is precise:

> Why does some "better" become "must,"  
> while other "better" remains optional?

Preference explains "better."  
Only value explains "must."

Until that difference is derived, normativity is an illusion.

---

### 0.0.8 Why Choice Alone Is Insufficient

Choice without value is arbitrary.

A system may choose repeatedly and still have no norms.

Randomness chooses.  
Optimization chooses.  
Selection chooses.

None of these generate obligation.

Choice becomes meaningful only when:

- some options cannot be chosen,
- without self-destruction.

---

### 0.0.9 The Danger of Moral Language

Words like:

- good,
- bad,
- right,
- wrong,
- should,

are **forbidden early** in this book.

They smuggle conclusions into premises.

This text will earn "ought" structurally—or not at all.

---

### 0.0.10 What This Book Will Not Do

This book will not:

- ground morality in nature,
- justify ethical systems,
- rank values,
- tell anyone how to live.

Those are applications.

This book identifies **conditions**.

---

### 0.0.11 The Central Claim (Preview)

The claim this book will defend is stark:

> **Value is not what a system wants.**  
> **Value is what a system cannot give up without ceasing to be itself.**

From this, choice becomes constrained.  
From constraint, normativity emerges.

No transcendence required.

---

### 0.0.12 How This Book Ends

This book will end when we can state, precisely:

- what value is,
- why choice can be tragic,
- how norms bind without morality,
- and where normativity stops.

It will not go further.

---

「価値は感情ではない。不可逆性である。」  
*Value is not emotion. It is irreversibility.*
