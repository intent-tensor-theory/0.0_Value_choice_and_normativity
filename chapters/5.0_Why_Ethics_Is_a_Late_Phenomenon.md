## Why Ethics Is a Late Phenomenon

**Progress: 100%**

---

「倫理は価値を作らない。価値の衝突を扱う。」  
*Ethics does not create value. It handles value collision.*

---

### 5.0.1 The Persistent Confusion

Ethics is often treated as foundational.

People ask:

- "What should we do?"
- "What is right?"
- "What is moral?"

Those questions are premature.

Ethics presupposes:

- value,
- normativity,
- identity-bearing agents,
- conflict among them.

None of these are primitive.

**This chapter explains why ethics must come after everything already derived.**

---

### 5.0.2 What Ethics Is Not

Ethics is not:

- the origin of value,
- the source of normativity,
- the generator of obligation,
- the ground of responsibility.

Any framework that assigns ethics this role is structurally inverted.

**Ethics does not create norms.**  
**It responds to them.**

---

### 5.0.3 Ethics Defined Precisely

We define ethics minimally and non-morally:

> **Ethics is the coordination of norms across multiple value-bearing systems.**

That is all.

Ethics does not determine what must matter.  
It negotiates what already matters to different selves.

---

### 5.0.4 Why Ethics Requires Plurality

A solitary system does not need ethics.

Ethics arises only when:

- multiple agents exist,
- each with inviolable norms,
- whose actions can affect one another.

Without plurality, there is no ethical problem.

Only normativity.

---

### 5.0.5 Why Ethics Is Inherently Incomplete

Because values are invariant and scarce, ethical systems face unavoidable limits.

No ethical framework can:

- preserve all values,
- satisfy all agents,
- avoid all norm violation.

**Ethics manages tradeoffs.**  
**It does not eliminate tragedy.**

This is not a flaw—it is a structural fact.

---

### 5.0.6 Why Ethics Cannot Be Universal at the Base

Universal ethics assumes:

- shared values,
- commensurable norms,
- identical identity anchors.

These conditions do not exist at the foundation.

Ethical universals emerge, if at all, only through:

- alignment,
- convergence,
- mutual constraint.

**They are achievements, not axioms.**

---

### 5.0.7 The Error of Moral Realism

Moral realism mistakes:

> stable convergence  
> for  
> external truth.

Norms feel absolute within a system.

Ethics misfires when that internal absoluteness is projected outward as cosmic law.

**There is no global normativity.**

There are only interacting identities.

---

### 5.0.8 The Error of Moral Relativism

Moral relativism makes the opposite mistake.

It treats norms as arbitrary preferences.

But we have shown:

- norms are non-arbitrary,
- inviolable,
- identity-defining.

They are local—but binding.

**Relativism dissolves obligation.**  
**Realism overextends it.**

Both fail.

---

### 5.0.9 Ethics as Damage Control

Ethics is not aspirational purity.

**It is damage control under constraint.**

It asks:

- how to minimize norm violation,
- how to distribute unavoidable loss,
- how to preserve identity where possible.

This is why ethical reasoning is hard.

---

### 5.0.10 Why Responsibility Reappears Here

Responsibility, in ethics, is not metaphysical blame.

It is attribution of normative resolution.

- Who bore the cost?
- Who resolved the conflict?
- Who absorbed the violation?

**Ethical responsibility tracks where collapse risk was carried.**

---

### 5.0.11 Transition Marker

Only one chapter remains.

It will not add machinery.

It will state clearly:

- what has been established,
- what this framework forbids,
- and where normativity ends.

---

「規範は命令ではなく、残存条件だった。」  
*Normativity was not command, but a condition for remaining.*
