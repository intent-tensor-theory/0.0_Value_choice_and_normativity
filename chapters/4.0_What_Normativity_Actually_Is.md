## What Normativity Actually Is

**Progress: 83.3%**

---

「規範は外から与えられない。内側で壊れる。」  
*Norms are not given from outside. They break from within.*

---

### 4.0.1 Why Normativity Must Be Rebuilt

Normativity is one of the most overburdened words in philosophy.

It is usually treated as:

- morality,
- rules,
- social enforcement,
- prescriptions imposed from outside.

All of these are late phenomena.

This book uses "normativity" in a stricter, earlier sense.

---

### 4.0.2 What Normativity Is Not

Normativity is not:

- moral goodness,
- social expectation,
- legal rule,
- rational requirement,
- cultural convention.

Those are **expressions** of normativity, not its source.

Normativity exists before any of them.

---

### 4.0.3 Normativity Defined Precisely

We now define normativity at the structural level:

> **Normativity is the presence of internal constraints whose violation results in loss of evaluative identity.**

This definition contains no moral language.

It contains only:

- identity,
- constraint,
- collapse.

---

### 4.0.4 Why Obligation Feels Absolute

Norms feel absolute because they are not weighed against alternatives.

A violated norm does not produce:

- a worse outcome,
- a lower utility.

It produces **self-fracture**.

The system is no longer able to evaluate coherently.

**This is why norms do not negotiate.**

---

### 4.0.5 The Difference Between Norms and Rules

Rules regulate behavior.  
**Norms regulate selfhood.**

Rules can be broken and repaired.  
Norms, when broken, dissolve something.

This is the sharpest distinction in the book.

---

### 4.0.6 Why Normativity Is Not External

External enforcement does not create normativity.

A system obeying under threat is constrained—but not normatively bound.

Normativity exists only when:

- the constraint is internal,
- violation is self-destructive,
- enforcement is unnecessary.

---

### 4.0.7 Normativity Without Morality

This framework allows normativity without:

- good vs evil,
- praise or blame,
- virtue or vice.

Normativity simply marks **inviolability**.

Morality is a later social encoding of this structure.

---

### 4.0.8 Why This Solves the "Is–Ought" Gap

The is–ought gap dissolves here.

"Ought" is not derived from facts about the world.

It arises from facts about **what must not be changed** for the system to remain itself.

The "ought" is internal, not descriptive.

---

### 4.0.9 The Shape of Normative Force

Normative force does not push.

**It forbids.**

It removes options rather than encouraging actions.

This negative character explains its rigidity.

---

### 4.0.10 Normativity Is Rare and Fragile

Because normativity depends on identity, it is fragile.

If:

- self-revision becomes unrestricted,
- evaluative coherence dissolves,

normativity disappears.

This is why normativity can collapse under pressure.

---

### 4.0.11 Transition Marker

We now understand normativity structurally.

Two chapters remain.

We must now distinguish:

- norms from laws,
- inviolability from enforcement.

Then we will close the book.

---

「破れないから守るのではない。破れば自分でなくなるからだ。」  
*Norms are not kept because they cannot be broken—they are kept because breaking them dissolves the self.*
