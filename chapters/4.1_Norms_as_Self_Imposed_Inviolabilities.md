## Norms as Self-Imposed Inviolabilities

---

「規範は守られるのではない。自己を守る。」  
*Norms are not protected. They protect the self.*

---

### 4.1.1 Why "Inviolability" Is the Right Word

Norms are often described as:

- rules,
- laws,
- duties,
- obligations.

All of these suggest enforcement.

**Inviolability does not.**

An inviolable constraint is not protected by force.  
It is protected by identity collapse.

This is the correct lens.

---

### 4.1.2 Self-Imposed Means Structurally Necessary

"Self-imposed" does not mean:

- chosen freely,
- consciously adopted,
- explicitly endorsed.

It means:

> The constraint arises from the system's own evaluative architecture, not from an external source.

The system did not decide to have the norm.  
**The norm emerged because revision without it became impossible.**

---

### 4.1.3 Why Norms Are Not Commands

Commands require an authority.

Norms require none.

A system does not obey its norms.  
**It cannot violate them and remain evaluative.**

This removes all moralized language from the foundation.

---

### 4.1.4 The Structural Shape of a Norm

A norm has a specific structure:

1. It constrains revision, not action directly
2. It forbids certain changes of self
3. It operates even when violation would be advantageous

This is why norms can conflict with preference, utility, or survival.

---

### 4.1.5 Why Norm Violation Is Different From Rule Violation

Breaking a rule:

- incurs a penalty,
- invites correction,
- leaves identity intact.

Violating a norm:

- fractures evaluative coherence,
- dissolves agency,
- produces loss of self.

**This difference explains why some violations feel irreparable.**

---

### 4.1.6 Norms Without Awareness

A system need not know its norms.

Normativity does not require reflection.

A system may violate a norm unknowingly and still suffer collapse.

**This explains why normativity predates moral reasoning.**

---

### 4.1.7 Why Norms Cannot Be Arbitrarily Added

One cannot simply "adopt" a norm.

A declared norm that can be abandoned without collapse is not a norm.

**True norms are load-bearing constraints.**

They are discovered when revision fails.

---

### 4.1.8 Norms and Identity Boundaries

Norms define the boundary of the self.

They mark:

- what may change,
- and what must not.

Crossing that boundary does not make the system "bad."

**It makes it other.**

---

### 4.1.9 Why This Explains Moral Injury

In human terms, this structure explains:

- moral injury,
- shame without punishment,
- guilt without witnesses.

These are phenomenological reflections of structural norm violation.

**The structure comes first.**

---

### 4.1.10 Transition Marker

We have now established:

- Value ✔
- Choice ✔
- Normativity ✔
- Norms as inviolabilities ✔

Only one distinction remains before closure:

Why norms are not laws, and why enforcement is secondary.

That is the final conceptual separation.

---

「法は破れる。規範は壊れる。」  
*Laws can be broken. Norms collapse.*
