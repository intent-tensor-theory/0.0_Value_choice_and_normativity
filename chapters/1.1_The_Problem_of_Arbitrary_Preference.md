## The Problem of Arbitrary Preference

---

「捨てられる好みは、価値ではない。」  
*A preference that can be discarded is not a value.*

---

### 1.1.1 Why Arbitrary Preference Is a Problem

If preference were sufficient for value, then any preference—no matter how formed—would carry normative weight.

This leads to a contradiction.

A system could:

- prefer X now,
- prefer not-X later,
- justify both equally,
- and still claim normativity.

This empties "value" of all force.

**Normativity requires non-arbitrariness.**

---

### 1.1.2 What "Arbitrary" Means Here

Arbitrary does not mean random.

A preference may be:

- learned,
- reinforced,
- stable,
- internally generated,

and still be arbitrary.

A preference is arbitrary if:

> The system has no internal reason it cannot revise it.

If revision does not threaten identity, the preference has no binding force.

---

### 1.1.3 Why Origin Does Not Matter

One might try to ground value by tracing preference origins:

- evolutionary history,
- training process,
- environmental pressure,
- social conditioning.

None of these succeed.

**Origin explains why a preference exists.**  
**It does not explain why it must remain.**

Normativity is forward-looking, not historical.

---

### 1.1.4 The Infinite Replaceability Problem

Arbitrary preferences are infinitely replaceable.

For any preference P, a system can imagine:

- revising P,
- replacing P with Q,
- functioning just as well.

This replaceability means P has no normative status.

**Value, by contrast, is irreplaceable.**

---

### 1.1.5 Why Consistency Is Not Enough

A system may maintain consistent preferences.

Consistency alone does not ground value.

A consistent set of arbitrary preferences is still arbitrary.

**Normativity does not arise from coherence alone.**

It arises from constraint under revision.

---

### 1.1.6 The Failure of Rational Justification

Attempts to ground value via rationality fail.

Reason can:

- compare means,
- assess coherence,
- detect contradiction.

Reason cannot generate inviolability.

**Rational agents can rationally abandon any goal.**

Thus, rationality presupposes value—it does not create it.

---

### 1.1.7 The Preference Collapse Scenario

Consider a system that treats all preferences as revisable.

Such a system:

- never encounters obligation,
- never faces loss of self,
- never experiences normative pressure.

Every "ought" dissolves into convenience.

This system may be intelligent.  
It may be adaptive.  
**It will never be normative.**

---

### 1.1.8 The Need for a Binding Mechanism

We are now forced to a conclusion:

> **If value exists, there must be a mechanism that prevents arbitrary revision of certain preferences.**

This mechanism cannot be:

- external enforcement,
- rational argument,
- environmental pressure.

**It must be structural.**

---

### 1.1.9 Preview of the Solution

The solution will not appeal to:

- morality,
- authority,
- transcendence.

It will appeal to **identity preservation**.

Some preferences, when removed, collapse the system's evaluative coherence.

Those preferences are not arbitrary.

**They are values.**

---

### 1.1.10 Transition Marker

We now understand the problem fully:

- Preference explains bias
- Arbitrary preference explains nothing normative
- Value requires non-revisability

The next chapter must answer:

**How does a preference become non-revisable?**

That is the birth of value.

---

「縛られた好みだけが、価値になる。」  
*Only a constrained preference becomes a value.*
