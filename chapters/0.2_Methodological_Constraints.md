# 章零・二 (Chapter 0.2)

## Methodological Constraints

---

This chapter establishes the rules that govern derivation throughout the book.

Violating any rule invalidates everything that follows.

---

### 0.2.1 Rule of No Moral Assumption

> **No moral claim may be assumed before normativity is derived.**

This rule forbids:

- treating "good" as primitive,
- invoking duties without construction,
- assuming ethical frameworks.

If morality appears, it must be **earned** through the derivation.

---

### 0.2.2 Rule of No External Justification

> **No appeal to external authority may ground value.**

This rule forbids:

- divine command,
- natural law,
- social contract as foundation,
- rational requirement as axiom.

Value must arise from structure, not imposition.

---

### 0.2.3 Rule of No Teleology

> **No assumption of purpose, design, or final cause.**

This rule forbids:

- treating systems as "meant" for anything,
- importing goals from outside,
- assuming directedness.

Normativity must emerge without built-in ends.

---

### 0.2.4 Rule of Earned Ought

> **"Ought" must be derived, not assumed.**

This rule forbids:

- treating obligation as primitive,
- using "should" before normativity is established,
- assuming any binding force.

If "ought" cannot be earned, it does not exist here.

---

### 0.2.5 Consequences of Violation

If any rule is violated:

- the derivation becomes circular,
- the conclusions become trivial,
- the explanation collapses into moralism.

Discipline here is not aesthetic.  
It is structural necessity.

---

### 0.2.6 Why These Constraints Are Liberating

These rules appear restrictive.

In practice, they are liberating.

They prevent:

- endless debates about which morality is right,
- appeals to contested authorities,
- projection of cultural biases.

By constraining vocabulary, they force precision.
