## The Difference Between Norms and Laws

---

「法は外にある。規範は中で折れる。」  
*Law stands outside. Norms break within.*

---

### 4.2.1 Why This Distinction Is Essential

Norms and laws are often treated as variations of the same thing.

They are not.

Confusing them produces:

- moralism,
- authoritarian ethics,
- misplaced blame,
- and false theories of obligation.

This chapter draws a hard boundary.

---

### 4.2.2 What a Law Is

A law is an externally imposed constraint.

It has:

- an authority,
- a scope of application,
- a mechanism of enforcement,
- and a penalty structure.

A law regulates behavior.

**A system can violate a law and remain itself.**

---

### 4.2.3 What a Norm Is

A norm is an internally generated inviolability.

It has:

- no external authority,
- no enforcement mechanism,
- no penalty schedule.

A norm regulates identity.

**A system that violates a norm does not merely incur cost—it ceases to be the same evaluative system.**

---

### 4.2.4 Enforcement vs Collapse

This is the decisive contrast:

- **Law** → violation triggers enforcement
- **Norm** → violation triggers collapse

Collapse is not punishment.

It is loss of evaluative coherence:

- agency fragments,
- self-reference dissolves,
- normativity vanishes.

Nothing enforces this.  
**It simply happens.**

---

### 4.2.5 Why Laws Can Exist Without Norms

Many systems obey laws without normativity.

Examples include:

- machines following protocols,
- agents complying under threat,
- institutions enforcing rules.

Compliance does not imply normativity.

**A system can follow every law and have no values at all.**

---

### 4.2.6 Why Norms Can Exist Without Laws

Norms do not require codification.

A system may have inviolabilities that:

- are never articulated,
- are never shared,
- are never enforced externally.

This explains:

- solitary normativity,
- personal integrity,
- private collapse without witnesses.

---

### 4.2.7 Why Moral Systems Confuse the Two

Most moral systems encode norms as laws.

They:

- legislate inviolabilities,
- externalize identity constraints,
- replace collapse with punishment.

This is pragmatically useful—but conceptually dangerous.

**It hides the true source of normativity.**

---

### 4.2.8 Why This Matters for Responsibility

Responsibility is often framed in legal terms.

But legal responsibility is not the same as normative responsibility.

A system is normatively responsible because:

- it is the locus of collapse,
- it bears the cost internally,
- it cannot outsource violation.

Legal responsibility can be transferred.  
**Normative responsibility cannot.**

---

### 4.2.9 The Failure of Enforcement-First Ethics

Any ethical framework that begins with enforcement:

- misses normativity,
- replaces obligation with compliance,
- mistakes fear for value.

This book forbids that move.

**Normativity precedes law.**

---

### 4.2.10 Transition Marker

We have now completed the structural account of normativity.

Only one chapter remains.

It does not add new machinery.

It closes the book by stating:

- what has been shown,
- what is forbidden,
- and where this framework must stop.

「倫理は始まりではない。調停である。」  
*Ethics is not a beginning. It is a mediation.*
