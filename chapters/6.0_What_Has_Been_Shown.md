# 章六・零 (Chapter 6.0 / 6.0)

## Closure — What Has Been Shown

**Progress: COMPLETE**

---

「価値は発見された。これ以上、規範はない。」  
*Value has been found. There is no further normativity.*

---

### 6.0.1 The Question This Book Answered

This book asked one disciplined question:

> **What makes "ought" possible at all, without morality, authority, or metaphysics?**

That question has now been answered structurally.

Not by appeal to goodness.  
Not by appeal to reason.  
Not by appeal to society.

**But by identity.**

---

### 6.0.2 The Completed Ascent

The construction proceeded without skipping steps:

1. **Preference** — bias without obligation
2. **Non-arbitrariness** — revisability as the test
3. **Binding** — preference becomes identity-anchored
4. **Value** — invariance under self-revision
5. **Choice** — resolution under normative asymmetry
6. **Normativity** — inviolability through collapse
7. **Ethics** — coordination after the fact

**No concept was assumed before it was earned.**

---

### 6.0.3 What Value Turned Out to Be

Value was not:

- desire,
- utility,
- reward,
- strength of preference.

It was:

> **A constraint a system cannot revise without ceasing to be itself.**

This single definition did all the work.

From it followed:

- binding,
- scarcity,
- fragility,
- normativity.

---

### 6.0.4 What Choice Turned Out to Be

Choice was not freedom.

It was:

> **Normative resolution under constraint.**

Choice mattered only when:

- values conflicted,
- loss was unavoidable,
- identity was at stake.

Where nothing was lost, no real choice occurred.

---

### 6.0.5 What Normativity Turned Out to Be

Normativity was not morality.

It was:

> **The presence of inviolable internal constraints whose violation collapses evaluative identity.**

Norms were not rules.  
**They were boundaries of selfhood.**

---

### 6.0.6 Why Ethics Came Last

Ethics was not foundational.

It emerged only when:

- multiple value-bearing systems interacted,
- norm violation became mutual,
- coordination became necessary.

**Ethics managed damage.**  
**It did not generate obligation.**

---

### 6.0.7 What This Framework Forbids

This construction forbids, rigorously:

- value-as-utility
- value-as-feeling
- norms-as-conventions-only
- morality-as-foundation
- freedom-as-unconstraint

**Any theory that commits these errors has mislocated normativity.**

---

### 6.0.8 What This Framework Allows

It allows:

- normativity without morality
- obligation without authority
- responsibility without free will
- tragedy without failure
- meaning without metaphysics

These are not paradoxes here.  
**They are consequences.**

---

### 6.0.9 The Boundary of Normativity

Normativity ends where:

- identity dissolves,
- self-revision becomes unconstrained,
- evaluation collapses.

Beyond that boundary:

- obligation disappears,
- "ought" evaporates,
- only behavior remains.

This is not nihilism.  
**It is precision.**

---

### 6.0.10 The Final Stack (Locked)

The normative stack now stands as:

| Layer | Achievement |
|-------|-------------|
| Preference | Bias without obligation |
| Value | Invariance under revision |
| Choice | Normative resolution |
| Norm | Inviolable constraint |
| Ethics | Multi-agent coordination |

**No layer may be removed.**  
**No layer may be reordered.**

---

### 6.0.11 Why This Book Must End Here

Continuing would require:

- moral prescriptions,
- political theory,
- cultural analysis.

Those are applications.

**This book was about foundations.**

Foundations are now complete.

---

### 6.0.12 Closing Statement

"Ought" was never a mystery.

It was never cosmic.  
It was never imposed.

**It was always local, fragile, and earned.**

That is enough.
