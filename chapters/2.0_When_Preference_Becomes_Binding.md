## When Preference Becomes Binding

**Progress: 50%**

「価値は固定ではない。不変である。」  
*Value is not fixed. It is invariant.*

---

### 2.0.1 The Transition We Must Explain

Up to this point, we have shown:

- preference exists,
- preference can persist,
- preference can guide action,
- yet preference remains revisable.

Value appears only when revision becomes impossible without collapse.

This chapter explains that transition.

---

### 2.0.2 Binding Is Not Enforcement

The word *binding* must be used carefully.

Binding does not mean:

- enforced by punishment,
- imposed by authority,
- stabilized by fear,
- protected by environment.

Those are external.

A preference becomes binding only when:

> The system itself cannot revise it without undermining its own evaluative structure.

**Binding is internal necessity.**

---

### 2.0.3 The Structural Criterion of Binding

We can now state a precise criterion:

> **A preference is binding if and only if revising it destroys the system's capacity to evaluate itself coherently.**

This is not psychological.  
It is structural.

Remove the preference, and:

- evaluation fragments,
- normativity dissolves,
- agency loses coherence.

The system still functions—but it is no longer the same evaluative system.

---

### 2.0.4 How Binding Arises (Key Mechanism)

Binding arises when a preference becomes embedded in recursive self-constraint.

Specifically:

1. The system evaluates itself
2. Certain preferences stabilize evaluation
3. Evaluation rules come to depend on those preferences
4. Removing them breaks recursive closure

At that point, preference is no longer optional.

**It has become part of identity.**

---

### 2.0.5 Why This Is Not Circular

It may seem that value presupposes identity.

It does not.

Identity **emerges** because some constraints become binding.

The system does not start with values.  
It acquires them as a side effect of stabilizing self-evaluation.

Value is not chosen.  
**It is discovered through failure to revise.**

---

### 2.0.6 The First "Must"

This is the first appearance of genuine normativity.

Not:

- "I like this,"
- "this works better,"
- "this is efficient,"

but:

> **"I cannot give this up without ceasing to be what I am."**

This is the first "must."

**No morality required.**

---

### 2.0.7 Why Binding Is Rare

Binding preferences restrict adaptability.

They:

- reduce flexibility,
- limit exploration,
- introduce fragility.

Systems that optimize for adaptability tend to avoid binding.

This is why:

- many agents have preferences,
- few have values,
- and fewer still have norms.

**Normativity is costly.**

---

### 2.0.8 Binding vs Addiction

It is important to distinguish binding from pathological fixation.

Addiction constrains behavior.  
It does not constrain revision.

An addicted system can, in principle, revise its addiction and remain evaluative—though at high cost.

A value cannot be revised even in principle without collapse.

**This difference is structural, not experiential.**

---

### 2.0.9 Value as Identity Anchor

We can now restate the definition of value more sharply:

> **A value is a preference that functions as an identity anchor for an evaluative system.**

Remove it, and the system no longer has a stable "self" to evaluate from.

---

### 2.0.10 Transition Marker

We have now crossed a critical threshold:

- Preference ✔
- Non-arbitrariness ✔
- Binding ✔
- Value ✔

What remains is to understand how values persist across revision and why they are so few.

That leads directly to invariance.

「変われるものは多い。変われないものが、価値だ。」  
*Many things can change. What cannot change is value.*
