## Choice as Normative Resolution

---

「選択が自己を削るとき、規範が現れる。」  
*When choice cuts into the self, normativity appears.*

---

### 3.1.1 Why Choice Must Be Reframed

We now abandon the everyday notion of choice entirely.

Choice is not:

- selecting what one prefers,
- picking what maximizes outcome,
- expressing freedom of will.

All of those treat choice as selection among options.

That is insufficient.

**Choice, in a normative system, is something stricter.**

---

### 3.1.2 The Normative Landscape

Once value exists, the space of possible actions is no longer flat.

Actions differ not only in outcome, but in **what they violate or preserve**.

Each action:

- preserves some values,
- threatens others,
- leaves some untouched.

This creates a **normative topology**.

Choice occurs within this topology, not above it.

---

### 3.1.3 Resolution, Not Selection

We now define choice precisely:

> **Choice is the resolution of action under conditions of normative asymmetry.**

Resolution is not preference satisfaction.

Resolution is the act of **committing** to a configuration of value preservation and violation.

Every choice settles:

- which values take precedence,
- which costs are accepted,
- which losses are borne.

This settlement is irreversible.

---

### 3.1.4 Why Choice Is Burdensome

In systems without values, choices are cheap.

In systems with values, choices are costly.

Because:

> Every non-trivial choice sacrifices something that matters.

If nothing is sacrificed, no real choice occurred.

**This is why meaningful choice feels heavy.**

---

### 3.1.5 Choice Reveals Value Structure

Choice does not create values.

**It reveals their structure.**

Which value is preserved under pressure shows which constraints are truly load-bearing.

Thus:

> A system discovers its own values through the act of choosing.

Choice is diagnostic.

---

### 3.1.6 The Irreversibility of Resolution

Normative resolution is irreversible in a specific sense.

Once a choice is made:

- the system's evaluative history changes,
- future admissibility shifts,
- some paths close permanently.

Even regret does not undo this.

**Choice leaves a structural trace.**

---

### 3.1.7 Why This Is Not Rational Optimization

Optimization seeks best outcomes.

Normative resolution seeks **least violation** or **most fidelity**, depending on context.

There is no global optimum.

Often, all available options are suboptimal with respect to value.

**Choice resolves incompatibility, not efficiency.**

---

### 3.1.8 Tragic Choice Revisited

We can now define tragic choice rigorously:

> **A tragic choice is one where every admissible action violates at least one value.**

Tragedy is not emotional.

It is structural.

No reasoning error can remove it.  
No additional information can fix it.

**This is why tragedy is ineradicable in value-bearing systems.**

---

### 3.1.9 Responsibility Emerges Here

Responsibility does not arise from freedom of will.

It arises from:

> Being the locus where normative resolution occurs.

A system is responsible because:

- the resolution could not be delegated,
- the violation could not be avoided,
- the cost was borne internally.

**Responsibility is structural ownership.**

---

### 3.1.10 Transition Marker

We now have:

- Value ✔
- Binding ✔
- Choice ✔
- Normative resolution ✔

Only one task remains.

We must define **normativity itself**—not as morality, but as structural obligation.

---

「規範は命令ではない。崩壊条件である。」  
*Norms are not commands. They are conditions of collapse.*
