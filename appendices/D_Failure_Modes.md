## Failure Modes — Nihilism, Moralism, Relativism

**Book II — Value, Choice, and Normativity**

---

「誤りは立場ではない。構造の崩れ方だ。」  
*Error is not a position. It is a mode of collapse.*

---

This appendix catalogues the three dominant failure modes that arise when value, choice, and normativity are mislocated.

These are not merely philosophical "views."  
**They are structural pathologies.**

Each failure mode corresponds to a specific error in the normative stack.

---

## D.0 The Diagnostic Principle

Every failure mode results from skipping or collapsing layers:

- collapsing preference into value,
- collapsing value into norm,
- or denying normativity entirely.

This appendix shows where each breaks.

---

## D.1 Nihilism — Denial of Binding

### Core Claim

> "Nothing truly matters."

### Structural Error

Denial of value invariance.

Nihilism assumes:

- all preferences are revisable,
- no constraint is identity-defining,
- all "oughts" reduce to convenience.

This is not skepticism.  
**It is a claim about revision.**

### Where It Breaks

Nihilism fails the revisability test.

It assumes all constraints are optional.

But any system capable of:

- self-reference,
- evaluative coherence,
- persistent agency,

**already contains non-revisable constraints.**

Nihilism ignores identity collapse.

### Structural Consequence

- No genuine obligation
- No tragic choice
- No responsibility
- No norm violation—only inefficiency

The system may function.  
**It cannot bind.**

### Why Nihilism Persists

Nihilism feels honest because:

- it rejects moral authority,
- it avoids metaphysics,
- it distrusts absolutes.

But it throws out identity-based normativity with morality.

**This is an overcorrection.**

### Summary Diagnosis

> Nihilism mistakes revisability for freedom and collapses normativity entirely.

---

## D.2 Moralism — Externalization of Norms

### Core Claim

> "There are universal moral rules that must be obeyed."

### Structural Error

Confusing norms with laws.

Moralism treats norms as:

- externally imposed,
- universally binding,
- enforceable by authority (divine, rational, or social).

**This reverses the direction of normativity.**

### Where It Breaks

Moralism fails the endogeneity condition.

Norms arise from:

- identity,
- self-constraint,
- collapse risk.

**They cannot be imposed without becoming laws.**

External imposition produces compliance, not obligation.

### Structural Consequence

- Norms become brittle
- Enforcement replaces identity
- Punishment replaces collapse
- Authority replaces responsibility

This produces:

- authoritarian ethics,
- moral absolutism,
- guilt without selfhood.

### Why Moralism Persists

Moralism feels necessary because:

- norms feel absolute from within,
- collapse feels catastrophic,
- people seek universal grounding.

**The mistake is projecting internal absoluteness outward.**

### Summary Diagnosis

> Moralism mistakes internal inviolability for external authority.

---

## D.3 Relativism — Reduction of Norms to Preference

### Core Claim

> "Values are just subjective preferences."

### Structural Error

Collapsing value into preference.

Relativism acknowledges plurality but denies bindingness.

It treats:

- values as tastes,
- norms as conventions,
- obligation as social agreement.

### Where It Breaks

Relativism fails the identity criterion.

Preferences can be revised.  
**Values cannot.**

Relativism cannot explain:

- why some violations destroy selves,
- why some choices are tragic,
- why norm violation feels irreparable.

### Structural Consequence

- No real obligation
- No non-arbitrary norm
- Ethics becomes negotiation only
- Identity becomes shallow

**Relativism dissolves normativity while pretending to respect difference.**

### Why Relativism Persists

Relativism feels tolerant because:

- it rejects absolutism,
- it honors plurality,
- it avoids coercion.

But it does so by denying inviolability, not by understanding it.

### Summary Diagnosis

> Relativism mistakes plurality for arbitrariness and empties normativity.

## D.4 Comparative Failure Matrix

| Failure Mode | What It Denies | Structural Collapse |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Nihilism | Value invariance | Obligation |
| Moralism | Endogenous normativity | Responsibility |
| Relativism | Binding constraints | Normativity |

**Each denies a different layer.**  
**All collapse the stack.**

---

## D.5 The Narrow Path (What This Framework Preserves)

This framework avoids all three by holding:

- **Values are real but local**
- **Norms are binding but internal**
- **Ethics is necessary but late**

No cosmic morality.  
No arbitrary preference.  
No empty freedom.

---

## D.6 Final Structural Statement

Normativity survives only if:

- values are invariant under revision,
- norms are inviolable but endogenous,
- ethics manages collision without pretending universality.

**Any deviation produces one of the three failure modes above.**

---

「否定も絶対も相対も、すべて崩れ方だった。」  
*Denial, absolutism, and relativism were all modes of collapse.*
