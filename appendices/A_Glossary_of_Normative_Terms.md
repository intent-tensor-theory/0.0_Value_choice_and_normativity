## Glossary of Normative Terms

**Book II — Value, Choice, and Normativity**

「言葉は定義されると、迷わなくなる。」  
*When words are defined, confusion collapses.*

This glossary fixes meanings as used in **this book only**.  
Common-language definitions are intentionally overridden.

**If a term here conflicts with everyday usage, this glossary wins.**

---

### Agency

The capacity of a system to bias future states according to internally generated, persistent evaluation.  
Agency does not require will, intention, or awareness.

---

### Arbitrary Preference

A preference that can be revised or abandoned without collapsing evaluative identity.  
All preferences that fail the revisability test are arbitrary.

---

### Binding

The condition under which a preference cannot be revised without destroying the system's evaluative coherence.  
Binding is internal necessity, not enforcement.

---

### Choice

The normative resolution of action among options that are not normatively equivalent.  
Choice is meaningful only when something inviolable is at stake.

---

### Collapse (Normative)

Loss of evaluative coherence resulting from violation of a value or norm.  
Distinct from physical collapse or failure.

---

### Constraint

A limitation on admissible states, actions, or revisions.  
Constraints may be external (rules, laws) or internal (values, norms).

---

### Endogenous

Arising from within the system's own structure, history, or evaluation—not imposed from outside.

---

### Ethics

The coordination and mediation of norm conflicts across multiple value-bearing systems.  
Ethics does not generate value; it manages collision.

---

### Evaluation

Internal comparison of states according to system-generated preference that alters future admissibility.  
Evaluation is necessary for selfhood but insufficient for value.

---

### Evaluative Identity

The stable structure that allows a system to evaluate itself coherently over time.  
Loss of evaluative identity results in normativity collapse.

---

### Freedom

The capacity to act in fidelity to one's values under constraint.  
Freedom is not unconstraint and not randomness.

---

### Identity Anchor

A value that stabilizes evaluative self-reference and prevents unrestricted revision.  
Identity anchors are rare and load-bearing.

---

### Inviolability

The property of a constraint whose violation results in loss of evaluative identity rather than mere cost.  
All norms are inviolable; not all constraints are.

---

### Law

An externally imposed rule regulating behavior, backed by enforcement mechanisms.  
Laws can be violated without loss of identity.

---

### Meaning

Difference that persists because it alters a system's self-constraints.  
Meaning is structural consequence, not representation.

---

### Norm

An internally generated, inviolable constraint whose violation collapses evaluative identity.  
Norms regulate selfhood, not behavior.

---

### Normativity

The presence of internal constraints whose violation produces identity collapse rather than suboptimal outcome.  
Normativity precedes morality.

---

### Normative Resolution

The act of settling incompatible value demands through choice, accepting unavoidable loss.  
Resolution is irreversible.

---

### Observer

A system that evaluates its own evaluations and alters future admissibility accordingly.  
Observers need not be conscious.

---

### Preference

An internally generated asymmetry that biases future admissibility but remains revisable.  
Preference alone carries no obligation.

---

### Revisability Test

Diagnostic rule:

> If X can be revised without loss of evaluative identity, X is not a value.

---

### Self-Constraint

Constraint arising from a system's own evaluated history that alters admissibility rules.  
Self-constraint is the basis of self-reference.

---

### Self-Reference

Condition in which a system's evaluated past participates in defining its future admissibility.  
Distinct from self-similarity or modeling.

---

### Tragic Choice

A choice in which every admissible option violates at least one value.  
Tragedy is structural, not emotional.

---

### Utility

A numerical representation of preference or payoff.  
Utility presupposes value; it cannot ground normativity.

---

### Value

A constraint a system cannot revise without ceasing to be itself.  
Values are invariant under self-revision and identity-defining.

---

### Will

A late phenomenological construct associated with conscious deliberation.  
Will is not foundational to agency, choice, or normativity.

*Defined words become structure.*
