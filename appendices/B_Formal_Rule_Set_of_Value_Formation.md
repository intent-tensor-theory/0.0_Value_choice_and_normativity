## Formal Rule Set of Value Formation

**Book II — Value, Choice, and Normativity**

---

「規則は命令ではない。生成条件である。」  
*Rules here are not prescriptions. They are conditions of emergence.*

---

This appendix presents the formal, minimal rule set under which value can arise in an evaluative system.  
These are **necessary and jointly sufficient** conditions within the framework of this book.

No psychological, moral, biological, or social assumptions are permitted.

---

## B.0 Scope and Preconditions

This rule set assumes the existence of:

- an evaluative system (Book I),
- endogenous preference,
- recursive self-reference,
- capacity for self-revision.

If any of these are absent, value formation is impossible.

---

## B.1 Rule 1 — Endogenous Evaluation Rule

> **A system must generate its own evaluative criteria.**

Formally:

- Let **E** be an evaluation operator.
- **E** must be defined internally by the system's recursive history.
- If **E** is externally imposed, value cannot arise.

**Failure mode:** obedience, not normativity.

---

## B.2 Rule 2 — Revisability Rule

> **Preferences must be revisable in principle.**

Formally:

- For any preference **P_i**, there must exist a revision operation **R(P_i)**
- such that the system remains evaluatively coherent unless a value condition is met.

This rule ensures that:

- preference ≠ value,
- binding is not assumed prematurely.

---

## B.3 Rule 3 — Identity Dependence Rule

> **Evaluation must depend on a subset of preferences for its own coherence.**

Formally:

- Let **P = {P_1, P_2, ...}**
- Let **E(P)** be the evaluative function
- There exists **P_k ∈ P** such that:

**E(P \ P_k) → evaluation failure**

Such **P_k** is a candidate value.

---

## B.4 Rule 4 — Non-Substitutability Rule

> **A value cannot be replaced by an alternative preference without collapse.**

Formally:

- For candidate value **V**,
- There exists no **P_j** such that:

**E(P \ V ∪ P_j) remains coherent**

If substitution is possible, the constraint is not a value.

---

## B.5 Rule 5 — Invariance Under Self-Revision

> **Values are invariant under all admissible self-revision operations.**

Formally:

- Let **R** be the set of self-revision operations.
- For value **V**:

**∀R ∈ R, R(V) → collapse**

This defines bindingness.

---

## B.6 Rule 6 — Load-Bearing Constraint Rule

> **A value must be structurally load-bearing within recursive self-constraint.**

Formally:

- The evaluative recursion must depend on **V** as part of its rule closure.
- Removing **V** breaks recursive self-reference.

This distinguishes:

- deep values

from

- surface invariants or habits.

---

## B.7 Rule 7 — Scarcity Constraint

> **The number of values must be minimal.**

Formally:

- Let **V ⊂ P** be the set of values.
- If **|V|** is too large, adaptive revision collapses entirely.

Systems that survive stabilize at:

**|V| ≪ |P|**

Scarcity is structural, not accidental.

---

## B.8 Rule 8 — Collapse Condition

> **Violation of a value produces evaluative identity collapse, not mere cost.**

Formally:

- If action or revision violates **V**:

**E → ∅** (loss of coherent evaluation)

This distinguishes:

- norm violation

from

- preference frustration.

---

## B.9 Rule 9 — Discovery, Not Declaration

> **Values are discovered through failed revision, not chosen.**

Formally:

1. A system attempts revision **R(V)**
2. Collapse occurs
3. The system stabilizes with **V** invariant

**Value emerges as a negative result.**

---

## B.10 Rule 10 — No External Justification Rule

> **Values require no external grounding.**

Formally:

No appeal to:

- truth,
- morality,
- utility,
- survival,
- authority.

Justification is internal coherence alone.

---

## B.11 Summary Schema

A constraint **X** is a value **iff**:

1. **X** is endogenous
2. **X** participates in evaluative self-reference
3. **X** is non-substitutable
4. **X** is invariant under self-revision
5. Violating **X** collapses evaluative identity

**All five are required.**

「価値は定義されなかった。失敗で明らかになった。」  
*Value was not defined. It was revealed by failure.*
