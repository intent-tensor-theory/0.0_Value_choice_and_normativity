## Preference vs Value vs Norm

**Book II — Value, Choice, and Normativity**

---

「似ているものほど、分けねばならない。」  
*The more similar things appear, the more precisely they must be separated.*

---

This appendix exists to prevent collapse by conflation.

Preference, value, and norm are often used interchangeably.  
**In this framework, doing so destroys normativity.**

They are three distinct structural layers, each stricter than the last.

## C.0 Overview Table (Structural Contrast)

| Feature | Preference | Value | Norm |
|---------|------------|-------|------|
| Revisable | Yes | No | No |
| Identity-defining | No | Yes | Yes |
| Generates obligation | No | Yes | Yes |
| Violation consequence | Suboptimal outcome | Identity threat | Identity collapse |
| Source | Evaluation | Self-revision invariance | Inviolability |
| Scarcity | Many | Few | Very few |
| Can conflict internally | Yes | Yes | Yes (catastrophic) |
| Requires awareness | No | No | No |

## C.1 Preference

### Definition (recap)

> An internally generated asymmetry that biases future admissibility.

### Structural Properties

- Revisable without contradiction
- Can be learned, reinforced, weakened, or replaced
- Guides behavior but does not bind identity

### Key Diagnostic

> If abandoning it leaves the system evaluatively coherent, it is preference.

### Failure Mode

Mistaking preference for value yields:

- arbitrary "oughts"
- collapsing normativity
- preference absolutism

---

## C.2 Value

### Definition (recap)

> A constraint a system cannot revise without ceasing to be itself.

### Structural Properties

- Invariant under self-revision
- Identity-anchoring
- Rare and load-bearing
- Discovered through failed revision

### Key Diagnostic

> If revising it destroys evaluative coherence, it is value.

### Relationship to Preference

- All values originate as preferences
- Almost all preferences fail to become values
- **Value is preference that became non-negotiable**

---

## C.3 Norm

### Definition (recap)

> An internally generated, inviolable constraint whose violation collapses evaluative identity.

### Structural Properties

- Operates at the level of selfhood
- Violation produces collapse, not cost
- Cannot be traded, outweighed, or optimized away

### Key Diagnostic

> If violating it dissolves agency and normativity, it is a norm.

### Relationship to Value

- All norms are values
- Not all values function as norms
- A value becomes a norm when:
  - it governs not just revision,
  - but the conditions for remaining a self at all.

---

## C.4 The Three-Level Progression

The correct structural progression is:

1. **Preference** — Bias in action
2. **Value** — Invariance under revision
3. **Norm** — Inviolability of identity

**Skipping steps produces error.**

---

## C.5 Common Confusions and Their Failures

### Confusion 1: Preference = Value

→ Leads to relativism and norm collapse

### Confusion 2: Value = Norm

→ Leads to moral absolutism and fragility

### Confusion 3: Norm = Law

→ Leads to authoritarian ethics

**Each confusion imports enforcement where collapse is the real mechanism.**

---

## C.6 Why Norms Are the Smallest Set

Norms are scarcer than values because:

- too many inviolabilities freeze action,
- too few dissolve identity.

Systems that survive normatively converge toward:

- minimal norm sets
- maximal coherence

**This explains why genuine norms are few and heavy.**

---

## C.7 Human Language vs Structural Reality

In everyday language:

- "value" often means preference,
- "principle" often means norm,
- "belief" is confused with both.

**This framework rejects that ambiguity.**

Words are assigned by structural role, not sentiment.

---

## C.8 Summary in One Sentence Each

- **Preference**: What the system tends to do
- **Value**: What the system cannot give up
- **Norm**: What the system cannot violate and remain itself

---

「好みは変わる。価値は残る。規範は折れる。」  
*Preferences change. Values remain. Norms break.*
